<h1>THE EIGHT-OARED VICTORS</h1>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<small>GREAT NEWS</small></h2>


<p>“And after this&mdash;the deluge, I suppose,”
quoted Tom Parsons as he gazed moodily out of
the window of his study, and watched the raindrops
splashing on the ledge, running down the
pipe, and forming one of many streams that trickled
over the green college campus. “Is it never
going to stop?” he went on, turning toward his
three chums. “It’s rained now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, for the love of differential calculus!” cried
Phil Clinton, “can’t you talk of anything but the
weather, Tom? I’m sick of hearing it discussed.”</p>

<p>“No sicker than I am of hearing it pour,” retorted
the first speaker.</p>

<p>“The rain certainly does seem to stick around,”
added Sid Henderson, as he endeavored to arise
from a decrepit armchair&mdash;one of the twins&mdash;that
added comfort to the college study. “I’m so
damp, and altogether gluey, that it’s all I can do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
to get up. Lend me a hand somebody!” he appealed.</p>

<p>“‘Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your
ears!’” recited Tom in the best schoolboy style.
“Can’t you manage to assist yourself, Sid; or are
you getting too fat?”</p>

<p>“Fat! Huh! I guess if you’d trained the way
I did for those track games you wouldn’t be fat!”
was shot out in protest.</p>

<p>“Train! Listen to him, Phil. Just because he
won his big jump he thinks that’s all there is.
Why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” put in Phil, quietly. “You fellows
will get on each other’s nerves if you continue. And
you’re certainly getting on mine. How do you
expect me to bone away if you’re going on like
this? That fussy alarm clock is bad enough&mdash;I
don’t know why we tolerate the old thing anyhow&mdash;but
when you two get to scrapping, and this
confounded rain never lets up, why it’s the extreme
edge, so to speak.”</p>

<p>“It is the rain, I guess,” spoke Tom Parsons,
in a low voice. “It’s enough to get on anyone’s
nerves. A straight week now,” and he drummed
on the wet window-pane, while Phil turned over
on an old sofa, that creaked dismally, and tried
to get a better light on his book. But the gloom
outside seemed to have found a place in the study
room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>“Easy on that ancient and honorable piece of
furniture!” cautioned Tom, as he looked anxiously
at the sofa, which seemed to groan in protest
at Phil’s weight. “It won’t stand much more
mending, and that’s no idle dream.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” said Phil, easily. “I think as
much of this sofa as any of you.”</p>

<p>“Um!” grunted Tom moodily, as he crossed
over to the other armchair and threw himself into
it at no small risk of going through the seat.
“What’s a fellow to do?” he asked.</p>

<p>Neither of his chums answered him. Sid had
managed to rise without anyone’s aid, and was
examining a pile of books, as though trying to
pick out the one containing the easiest lessons.</p>

<p>“Where’s Frank?” asked Tom, after a silence.</p>

<p>“I saw the Big Californian crossing the campus
awhile ago,” replied Phil, closing his book and
yawning. “He was bundled up in a raincoat, and
seemed as chipper as a clam at high tide.”</p>

<p>“Wish I had the spunk to go out,” commented
Sid. “The river must be nearly flood-high by
this time, with all the water that’s fallen.”</p>

<p>“Water! Ugh! Don’t mention it,” begged
Tom.</p>

<p>Silence reigned in the room, broken only by
the ticking of the fussy little alarm clock. There
was the rustle of the pages, as the two lads, studying,
turned to various lessons. Tom got up with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
an impatient exclamation, and passed into one of
the four small bedrooms that opened out of the
main study.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll take a chance and go out!” he announced.
“It’s as dull as ditchwater in here. You
fellows are about as cheerful as a wake.”</p>

<p>“Um!” grunted Phil. Sid did not take the
trouble to reply.</p>

<p>“That’s right. Be grumpy!” said Tom, sarcastically.</p>

<p>Clearly the weather was getting on the nerves
of all of them. And small wonder, for it had
rained almost steadily for a week, and the stone
piles that made up Randall College seemed soaked
through to the very wall paper. The campus was
like a sponge, and the walks, where they were not
gravel, were ribbons of mud.</p>

<p>“Lucky we got our Spring games over with, before
this flood set in,” went on Tom.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter; have you fellows lost your
tongues?” he demanded, sharply.</p>

<p>He paused in the act of slipping off a lounging
coat preparatory to putting on an outdoor garment.
Sid and Phil avoided his glance. At that moment
the door into the hall opened and there stepped
into the study a big lad, attired in a raincoat, that
dripped moisture at every seam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hello, Duck!” greeted Sid with a cheerful
grin.</p>

<p>“Where have you been, Frank?” asked Tom.
“I was just coming out to join you.”</p>

<p>Evidently this was Frank Simpson, the “Big
Californian,” the reason for the nickname being
obvious.</p>

<p>“Come ahead&mdash;all of you,” invited Frank. “It
isn’t so bad, and I guess it’s going to clear up.”</p>

<p>“I believe you’re right!” agreed Tom, and
there was an instant change in his voice. “It has
almost stopped. Come on!” he cried. “You fellows
stop boning, and we’ll make a party of it.
It’s early yet, only the clouds make it seem dark.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” suggested Frank, as he saw
that the others were likely to fall in with Tom’s
idea. “Have you fellows heard the news?”</p>

<p>“Has Moses granted a Roman holiday?” asked
Sid.</p>

<p>“Or has Pitchfork consented to resign?” added
Phil.</p>

<p>“Neither one. This is the greatest news ever.
And it’s just the kind of a day to impart it, for it
has to do with water. Fellows, do you think Randall
could get into the rowing game&mdash;I mean as it
ought to be gotten into? Do you think we could
make up a crew&mdash;or two crews for that matter&mdash;an
eight and four&mdash;that could put it all over Boxer
Hall and Fairview Academy? Do you think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
we could turn out some four-and-eight-oared victors?”</p>

<p>Frank paused in his enthusiastic questions, and
gazed at his chums through a mist of moisture
that seemed to emanate from his damp person.</p>

<p>“Do you?” he repeated, for they were silent.</p>

<p>“What does he mean?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“He speaketh in riddles,” added Phil.</p>

<p>“Mayhap he but jesteth,” came from Sid.</p>

<p>“No joke at all,” said Frank with a smiling
good nature. “This is the very latest news, and
I think I’m one of the first fellows to hear it.
Listen and I will a tale unfold.”</p>

<p>“Well, as long as it’s only a tale you’re going
to unfold, and not that wet raincoat, proceed, most
noble Brutus,” begged Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, let up with the jollying, and let’s hear the
news,” suggested Phil.</p>

<p>“In brief, then, it’s this,” went on Frank. “A
number of old grads, who, it seems, used to be
fonder of rowing and sculling than anything else
when they were at Randall, have had a meeting,
and they decided to subscribe ten thousand dollars
to fit us up with a dandy boathouse and shells&mdash;that
is if we’ll consent to accept&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Accept! I guess yes, with running shoes on!”
cried Phil.</p>

<p>“There’s a sort of a string attached to it,” went
on Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is it? Do we have to raise an additional
ten thousand dollars?” asked Tom, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“No, nothing as hard as that. But we have to
form a regular rowing association, and promise
to work our level best to be the champions of the
river and lake. Shall we do it?”</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence. And then Tom
cried:</p>

<p>“Of course we will!”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t we?” demanded Phil.</p>

<p>“Say, this is great!” came from Sid. “Randall
going to have a crew at last! It’s about time.
But I say,” he went on, “it’s too late this term to
think of it. Why we only have a few more weeks
before the Summer vacation.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” replied Frank, “and the idea is
to get things in shape the remainder of this term,
and have a regatta early in the Fall, before the
football season opens. I think we can induce Boxer
Hall and Fairview to enter into that sort of
agreement, even if those two colleges do row each
other every Spring.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” commented Tom.</p>

<p>“Say, Frank, how comes it that you know all
this?” asked Sid.</p>

<p>“Merely by accident,” answered the Big Californian.
“I was coming across the campus just
now, plowing along through the water with my
head down, and I ran plump into Moses and Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Marshall. I begged their pardons, of course, and
was about to go on when Moses, looking at the
doctor, said:</p>

<p>“‘Perhaps we had better tell him, and have him
sound some of the others.’”</p>

<p>“I began to pick up my ears at that and wonder
what was in the wind. And when Dr. Marshall
came back with: ‘It wouldn’t be a bad idea,’ I
knew something was up. The upshot of it was
that Moses took me into his confidence. Ahem!”
and Frank swelled up his chest.</p>

<p>“Go on, you rooster!” commanded Tom.</p>

<p>“Tell us about the crew,” begged Sid.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s it. Dr. Churchill said he had just
received the offer from a number of the wealthy
old grads. who, it seems, got together, had a sort
of meeting, and voted that the decline of water
activity at Randall College was a shame.</p>

<p>“It seems that they used to be regular sharks at
rowing in their day, and they passed a resolution
that, whereas Randall had done well at baseball,
football and in track athletics, nevertheless she
was a back number when it came to rowing.</p>

<p>“Therefore, ‘be it resolved, and it is hereby
resolved,’ and all that sort of thing, you know.
Then they subscribed the ten thousand dollars, and
the only condition is that we promise to do our
best to become champions.”</p>

<p>“Which we’ll do without question,” said Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course,” added Phil.</p>

<p>“But it’s going to take a lot of work,” commented
Sid. “We’ll need all the time between
now and Fall to get in shape. But what can we
practice in? We haven’t any decent shells.”</p>

<p>“We can get some second-hand ones for practice,”
said Frank, “and I understand the old grads
will have the new ones ready for us in the Fall,
together with the new boathouse. We can also
practice during our vacation.”</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Tom. “It makes me feel better
already. I want to get out on the water right
now.”</p>

<p>“And a little while ago you thought there was
altogether too much water,” commented Phil,
drily.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” excused Tom, with a shrug of his
shoulders. “I say, it is clearing!” he cried.
“Come on down and get into a boat. Even one
of the old tubs will answer, and we can talk this
thing over.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I came in to propose,” said
Frank. “As we are among the older students
here, it will be sort of up to us to spread the idea.
I think everybody will take to it, though.”</p>

<p>“It’s about time we took a fall out of Boxer
Hall on the water,” declared Sid. “Fairview isn’t
in it so much, though she came mighty near beating
Boxer in the eight one year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The rain had ceased, there probably being no
more water left in the sky, as Sid remarked. The
four chums&mdash;the “Inseparables,” as they were
called, slipped off their lounging jackets&mdash;at least
Sid and Phil did, for Tom already had done so&mdash;and
soon all were on their way to Sunny River,
on the bank of which the various buildings of Randall
College were situated. Over the soggy campus
they took their way, meeting no one, for no
one else seemed to have the courage to venture
out.</p>

<p>Though the institution had not boasted of a
rowing association, or crew, in some years, there
was a boathouse, and a number of craft owned by
the students, and it was toward this structure that
our friends betook themselves.</p>

<p>“Let’s take the big barge,” suggested Tom.
“Then we can all get in it and talk.”</p>

<p>“It’s as heavy as lead,” complained Phil. “It
will be all right rowing down stream, but coming
back we’ll have a hard pull.”</p>

<p>“What of it?” demanded Frank. “It will be
good practice for us if we’re going to try for the
crew.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, we will have to make tries to see
who are the best oarsmen,” remarked Tom. “I
wonder if Mr. Lighton is a good coach when it
comes to rowing? I know he’s all right at football
and baseball, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“I believe Dr. Churchill mentioned that if we
took up this offer, one of the old grads, who was
a crackerjack oarsman in his day, might come and
give us some pointers,” put in Frank.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s get out. Say, but the river is high,
though,” Tom exclaimed, as they came in sight
of the stream. The rain of the past week had
raised it considerably, and it was now rushing
swiftly along, a muddy stream, far from bearing
out its name&mdash;Sunny.</p>

<p>“The barge is as safe as a ferry-boat,” commented
Sid. “It can’t upset.”</p>

<p>“All right, I’m game,” declared Tom. “Let’s
row down to Tonoka Lake, and see what’s going
on there.”</p>

<p>This lake was a large body of water into which
the river emptied&mdash;in fact it was more like the
widening of the stream than a real lake, but a lake
it was called in spite of that. In its centre was
Crest Island, of good size.</p>

<p>Soon the four students were in the barge, a four-oared
craft, with enough seats so that the quartette
could row with an oar each, after the manner of
those in a shell.</p>

<p>“Take out the rudder,” directed Frank. “We’ll
have to make our own course, for it can’t be
worked by one’s feet as in a four-oared shell.”</p>

<p>Phil unshipped the rudder, and they rowed out
into the middle of the stream. It was easy going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
down with the current, but they realized that it
would be harder coming back. However, they
were out for practice as much as anything else, and
did not mind a stiff pull.</p>

<p>“I wonder what sort of a stroke we pull?” said
Tom, as they rowed on.</p>

<p>“Oh, we probably have lots of faults,” admitted
Frank. “But they can be corrected.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty big chunk to bite off&mdash;to think of
beating Boxer Hall, where the fellows have been
rowing for years, and we just starting in,” commented
Sid.</p>

<p>“Oh, stranger things have happened,” declared
Tom. “We can do it.”</p>

<p>Then began a spirited discussion of the splendid
offer that had been made to Randall, and a talk
as to what the other students would think of it.
The four chums were enthusiastic over the prospect.</p>

<p>“Say,” called Tom, after a bit. “This is all
right, and lots of fun, but we’ve come down quite
a way, and we’ve got to think of going back. This
current is fierce.”</p>

<p>“Quitter!” called Phil.</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort&mdash;I’ve got common-sense,”
was the retort.</p>

<p>“Tom is right,” said Frank Simpson, in a quiet
voice. “We mustn’t overdo the thing. It is going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to be a stiffish pull back, and we don’t want to be
late for dinner&mdash;I don’t anyhow.”</p>

<p>They had rowed down to where the river widened
into the lake. There was a Summer picnic
ground near here, and on the higher slopes of land,
back from the water, were a number of fine residences,
the estates running down to the shore edge.
Many of the places had boathouses.</p>

<p>As the boys came opposite one of these they
saw a small motor-boat turn in toward a shelter,
the doors of which were open. There was a lone
man in the boat, and he skillfully directed her
course across the current.</p>

<p>“Let’s pull over there and rest before going
back,” suggested Sid, and the others agreed. They
reached the boathouse and dock in time to see the
man in the motor-boat close and lock the door,
with his craft inside. Apparently he did not notice
the boys, who were working to get in on the downstream
side of the float, so they could be out of
the current for a little while.</p>

<p>“There,” remarked the man from the motor-boat,
as he walked out of the shore-door of the
house, also locking that after him, “I guess things
will be safe in there until I come back. I won’t
be gone long. Maybe I ought to take them with
me but they’re heavy, and I’ve got to go up hill&mdash;I
guess I’ll leave them,” and he started up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
slope from the river, toward a fine residence on
the hill.</p>

<p>“He must have money in the bank&mdash;talking to
himself that way,” remarked Tom, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“I wonder what it is he’s leaving in his boat?”
spoke Phil.</p>

<p>“He trusts us, anyhow,” laughed Frank.</p>

<p>“He didn’t see us,” came from Sid. “Anyhow
the place is locked.”</p>

<p>The boys rested there by the boathouse for several
minutes.</p>

<p>Tom was about to propose that they start back,
for it looked cloudy again, as if the rain would
begin once more. But before he could mention
this fact Sid exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Here comes the Boxer Hall shell! Say, look
at those fellows row!”</p>

<p>“They are hitting up the pace!” agreed Frank.</p>

<p>All looked to see a fine eight-oared shell fairly
scudding over the water under the impulse of the
sixteen sturdy arms of the rowers.</p>

<p>“We’ll soon be doing that,” said Phil, in a low
voice. And then some of the lads in the shell
looked over and saw our friends.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<small>THE FLOOD</small></h2>


<p>“Hello, you fellows!” called Dave Ogden,
who was acting as the coxswain of the shell, waving
his megaphone at them. “Out for practice?”
and he grinned as he looked at the heavy barge.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’re getting ready to order a new shell,”
answered Tom.</p>

<p>“Ha! Ha! That’s pretty good. Maybe you
think you can beat us rowing!” and Dave looked
not a little proudly at the eight lads whose efforts
he had been directing. They had been out for a
spin on the lake, and were now coming back rather
leisurely.</p>

<p>“We will beat you&mdash;some day!” declared
Frank.</p>

<p>“Maybe you’d better not tell them about our
shell until we get it,” suggested Tom, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ll have to know it some time or
other,” declared Frank. “It will be all over the
college in a day or so, and Boxer Hall is sure to
learn of it. Besides, I want to get things stirred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
up a bit. But they’ll only think we’re joking, so
far.”</p>

<p>The eight-oared shell passed on with a sweep,
the rowers making good time against the current.
But then the craft was so much like a knife that it
offered scarcely any resistance to the water.</p>

<p>“Row easy, all!” came the command from
Dave Ogden, and the rowers reduced the number
of their strokes per minute. They were closer to
shore now, and out of the worst grip of the current.
The coxswain waved his megaphone at our
friends in a friendly fashion, and then gave his
attention to his crew. Though there was rivalry&mdash;sometimes
bitter&mdash;between Randall and Boxer
Hall, the students were, for the most part, very
friendly.</p>

<p>“Jove! It will be great to get in that game!”
exclaimed Tom with a sigh, as he watched the
rival’s shell.</p>

<p>“And we’ll do it, too!” declared Frank, earnestly.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s be getting back,” suggested Sid;
and the others agreed that this might be a wise
thing to do.</p>

<p>And while they are returning to college I will,
in order that my new readers may have a better
understanding of the characters, tell something of
the books that precede this in the “College Sports
Series.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Our first volume was called “The Rival Pitchers,”
and told how Tom Parsons, then a raw country
lad, came to Randall College, with the idea of
getting on the baseball nine. He succeeded, but
it was only after a hard struggle and bitter rivalry.
Tom made good against heavy odds. The second
volume had to deal with college football, under
the title, “A Quarter-back’s Pluck,” and in that
I related how Phil Clinton, under trying circumstances,
won the championship gridiron battle for
his eleven.</p>

<p>“Batting to Win,” the third book of the series,
was, as the title indicates, a baseball story. Besides
the accounts of the diamond contests, there
was related the manner in which was solved a
queer mystery surrounding Sid Henderson. Going
back to football interests, in the fourth book, “The
Winning Touchdown,” there will be found many
accounts of pigskin matters. Also how Tom Parsons,
and his chums, saved the college from ruin
in a strange manner.</p>

<p>The book immediately preceding this volume
was “For the Honor of Randall,” and while it
was, in the main, a story of various college athletics,
there is detailed how a certain charge, involving
the honor of Frank Simpson, and incidentally
his college, was disproved.</p>

<p>My old readers know much about Randall, but
I might mention, for the benefit of my new friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
that the college was located on the outskirts of the
town of Haddonfield, in the middle west. Near
the institution ran Sunny River, as I have said, and
it was on this stream, and the connecting lake, that
it was proposed to have Randall enter into aquatic
sports. Randall, Boxer Hall and Fairview Institute&mdash;the
latter a co-educational college&mdash;had
formed the Tonoka Lake League in athletics,
though in rowing only the two latter colleges had
competed. But this was soon to be changed.</p>

<p>At the head of Randall was Dr. Albertus
Churchill, dubbed Moses, in affectionate terms.
Dr. Emerson Tines, alias “Pitchfork,” was head
Latin instructor, and Mr. Andrew Zane was proctor.
Dr. Marshall was a physician in residence,
and also gave instruction in various lines.</p>

<p>Tom, Phil, Sid and Frank roomed together.
Formerly they had had a large single dormitory
to themselves, doing their studying there, and going
from there to classes, lectures or chapel&mdash;but
not the latter when it could conveniently be “cut.”
In the book just before this I told of the Spring
track games in which Randall had managed to
come out the victor. These had been past a week
or two when the present story opens.</p>

<p>Just after the games there had been thrown
open to the use of the students a new dormitory,
and study-building, with rooms arranged <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en suite</i>,
and the four chums had taken a large central apartment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
with bedrooms opening from it. This gave
them a much more convenient place than formerly.</p>

<p>But, if they changed their room, they did not
change the furniture&mdash;at least they kept all the
old, though getting some new. Among the
former, were the two ancient armchairs, known to
my readers, and the decrepit sofa, which had been
mended until it seemed that nothing of the original
was there. And then there was the alarm clock,
which served to awaken the lads&mdash;that is, when
they did not stop it from ticking by jabbing a toothpick
somewhere up in the interior mechanism.</p>

<p>As for the friends of our heroes they were
many, and their enemies few. You will meet them,
old as well as new, as the story progresses.</p>

<p>“There sure is some water!” exclaimed Tom,
as he gazed from shore to shore of the turbulent
stream.</p>

<p>“And it’s getting higher,” added Phil.</p>

<p>“And going to rain more,” came from Sid.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’ll be a flood sure, if you calamity-howlers
have your way,” remarked Frank. “Give
way there! What are you doing, Phil&mdash;stalling on
me?”</p>

<p>“Say, who made you the coxswain, anyhow?”
demanded the aggrieved one.</p>

<p>The boys reached Randall just as the downpour
began again, but their spirits had been raised by
the row, and by the good news which Frank had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
heard. It was confirmed a little later by an announcement
on the bulletin board, calling for a
meeting of the athletic committee, within a few
days, to consider the matter.</p>

<p>“Say, this is going to be great!” cried Holly
Cross, one of the football squad. “Rowing is
something Randall always needed.”</p>

<p>“And she needs rowers, too, don’t forget that,
Holly, me lad!” exclaimed Bricktop Molloy, a
genial Irish lad who was taking a post-graduate
course, after an absence of some time at Columbia
and with a mining concern. Some said he came
back to Randall merely because he loved her athletics
so, but Bricktop, with a ruffling up of his red
hair would say, half-savagely:</p>

<p>“I deny the allegation, sir, and I defy the alligator!”
an old joke but a good one.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll get the rowers,” was the confident
declaration of many, and then the lads, gathering
in the gymnasium, or in the rooms of one and another,
talked over the coming rowing contests.</p>

<p>It rained all night, and part of the next day, and
then seemed to clear off for good.</p>

<p>“What about another spin on the river?” asked
Tom, after his last lecture. “I’m ready for it.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” declared Sid, and the remaining two
fell into line. Several other lads agreed to accompany
the four inseparables, and soon quite a
group was headed for the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, look at that; would you!” cried Phil, as
they came in sight of the stream. “That’s a flood
all right!”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” remarked Tom. “Why,
it’s almost up to the doors of the boathouse, and it
hasn’t been that high in years!”</p>

<p>“Some water,” agreed Frank. “I wonder if
it’s safe to go out? Look at that current!”</p>

<p>“Safe! Of course it’s safe!” exclaimed Phil.
“I’ve seen it worse.”</p>

<p>“But not with so much wreckage in the river,”
added Tom. “Look at those big logs. If one of
them even hit the barge it would smash a hole in
it.”</p>

<p>“There’s part of a chicken-coop!” cried Sid,
pointing to the object floating down the river.</p>

<p>“Yes, and there’s half a cow-shed, if I’m any
judge,” went on Frank.</p>

<p>“The river sure is high,” conceded Phil. “I
did want to take a run down to Fairview, and see
Sis, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“See your sister!” jeered Sid. “I know who
you want to see down there all right,” for while
Phil’s sister, Ruth, attended the co-educational institution,
so did Madge Tyler, of whom Phil was
very fond, and also Mabel Harrison, in whom Sid
was more than ordinarily interested. Besides,
there were “others.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was going to row down,” declared Phil,
stoutly. “But I can go by trolley.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s try a little row,” suggested Tom. “If
we find the current is too strong, we can come back
and take a car. I’d like to see the girls.”</p>

<p>“Brave youth! To admit that!” exclaimed
Frank. “I fancy we all would. Well, let’s get out
the boat.”</p>

<p>But they found the flood too much for them.
Venturing only a little way out from shore they
were gripped in the current with such force that
they saw it would be folly to proceed. Accordingly,
they put back, as did their companions in other
boats.</p>

<p>As they were tying up at the boathouse, Wallops,
one of the college messengers, came in.</p>

<p>“Did you hear about it?” he demanded, apparently
much excited.</p>

<p>“About what?” he was asked.</p>

<p>“A lot of boathouses down the river have been
washed away in the flood,” he went on. “The
small one at Boxer Hall came near going, but they
anchored it with ropes. One of their small shells
was smashed. Oh, it’s a bad flood all right!”</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t help it,” said Tom. “I guess
the trolley cars are still running. Come on, fellows,
if we’re going to Fairview Institute.”</p>

<p>So, leaving the boathouse, they started for the
trolley line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“We’ll take a row down the river to-morrow,
and see what damage the flood did,” called Sid to
Wallops, as they moved away. They little realized
what they would find, or what part it would
play in the history of Randall.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>THE MISSING TROPHIES</small></h2>


<p>“Boys, you really must go!”</p>

<p>“Oh, can’t we stay just a bit longer?”</p>

<p>“No, not another minute. Miss Philock has
sent up twice to say that you’ve stayed long
enough.”</p>

<p>“I think her clock is wrong.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t been here ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Sid Henderson! Why, it’s over half an
hour!” exclaimed Mabel Harrison.</p>

<p>“And he’s the fellow who didn’t use to like the
girls!” said Tom, with conviction. “Oh, Rome,
how art thou fallen!”</p>

<p>“Cut it out!” growled Sid, under his breath.</p>

<p>The four chums had called on their friends and
Phil’s sister at Fairview Institute, and the result
can easily be imagined by the foregoing conversation.
There had been jolly talk, a telling of the
new chance that had unexpectedly come to Randall,
and then the appeal of the girls that the boys
must go&mdash;not because the girls wanted them to&mdash;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
because Miss Philock, the head of the co-educational
institution, deemed it necessary.</p>

<p>“But we can come again; can’t we?” asked
Frank, as they paused at the door. Somewhere
down the corridor a thin lady, with thin lips, was
narrowly watching the group of young people.</p>

<p>“Sure we can come again!” declared Phil.
“They can’t stop me from seeing my sister.”</p>

<p>“Or someone else’s,” put in Tom, mischievously.</p>

<p>“Tom! Stop it!” cried Madge Tyler. “She’ll
hear you.”</p>

<p>“But we will come!” declared Frank.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how we poor girls can prevent
you,” said Helen Newton, with a mischievous
glance of her eyes.</p>

<p>“Young ladies!” came a warning voice from
down the corridor.</p>

<p>“Oh, you really must go!” exclaimed Ruth
Clinton.</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Tom. “We’ll be back
soon. When is the next dance?”</p>

<p>“We’ll send you cards,” replied Madge Tyler.
“Good-bye!”</p>

<p>And the boys moved off, with many backward
glances, while the girls lingered in the doorway of
the reception hall until Miss Philock advanced to
garner them into her charge.</p>

<p>“Young ladies!” she began severely, “if your
friends overstay their time again I shall not permit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
them to see you&mdash;even if they are <em>brothers</em>!”
and she looked at Ruth.</p>

<p>“Horrid thing!” murmured Madge. “I’ll be
glad when vacation comes.”</p>

<p>“Are your folks going to camp on Crest Island
again?” asked Ruth, naming the resort in Tonoka
Lake.</p>

<p>“I think so. Papa sent a man up to look over
the cottage this week, to see if it needed any repairs.
And, girls, if we do go, I want you all to
spend several weeks with me!” cried Madge Tyler.
“We will have a scrumptious time!”</p>

<p>When the boys got back to Randall they found
some mild excitement there. Further word had
come from the committee of old graduates that
they had perfected their arrangements in the matter
of supplying Randall with all that was necessary
to enter into aquatic sports, and there was a
request that the students at once hold a meeting,
and decide whether or not they would accept the
offer.</p>

<p>Of course it is not necessary to say that the
boys did accept. A meeting was called for that
same evening, and it was enthusiastically voted to
accept the generous offer, with thanks. It was
voted to have an eight-oared crew, as well as a
four, while as many singles as could be arranged,
with possibly a double. A committee was appointed
to secure some second-hand shells for practice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
pending the arrival of the new ones in the
Fall.</p>

<p>Another committee was named to negotiate
with Boxer Hall and Fairview Institute, looking to
planning for the races in the Fall.</p>

<p>“If they won’t meet us then, we’ll have to wait
until next Spring,” said Frank Simpson.</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess they’re sports enough to give us
a race this Fall,” declared Tom. “We’ll try, anyhow.”</p>

<p>It was now June and the weather, after the long
rain, was perfect. Within a few days Boxer
Hall and Fairview would meet in their annual
water carnival, swimming as well as boat races,
and, as some of the Randall boys had entered in
the swimming contests, it was planned to send a
big delegation from that college to the meet.</p>

<p>“We can get a line on their rowing that way,”
said Sid, and the others agreed with him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the flooded river was subsiding, and
a few days after their visit to the girls, our four
friends went out for a row again. In the meanwhile
they had secured some books on the subject
of sculling, and, as they went down stream,
they endeavored to correct their faults.</p>

<p>But, as is always the case when you try to do
something opposite to the way you have learned it,
whether that way be good or bad, there was
trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can’t row for a cent the way the book says it
ought to be done,” declared Tom.</p>

<p>“Me either,” came from Sid.</p>

<p>“And yet that’s the right way,” said Frank. “I
guess we’ll get on to it after a bit. But let’s row
our old way now, and go down to Crest Island.
That will make a good distance, and test our wind.
Later we can row right. Anyhow, if we have a
coach he’ll show us the ropes. Give way now,
everybody!”</p>

<p>They made good speed, and, a little later, were
nearing the island, the largest one of three or four
that dotted the lake. Crest Island was the home
of several cottagers in Summer.</p>

<p>“Look! What’s that!” cried Tom, as they
neared the upper point of the bit of water-surrounded
land.</p>

<p>“Looks like a boat wrecked there!” said Phil.</p>

<p>“It is,” declared Sid. “It’s smashed on the
rocks.”</p>

<p>“Let’s take a look,” suggested Frank. “Maybe
it’s worth saving.”</p>

<p>“It’s a motor-boat,” said Tom, as they came
nearer. “But I guess there isn’t much left of it.”</p>

<p>“And there’s part of the boathouse it was evidently
in,” came from Phil. “Probably it was
carried away by the flood&mdash;boat, boathouse and
all, and smashed on these rocks.”</p>

<p>By this time they had brought their boat to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
island shore, and, getting out, they examined the
wreck. Truly it had been a bad smash. The hull
itself could never be used again, and it was a question
whether the engine could, as one of the cylinders
was badly cracked. The seat lockers had
been broken open, and nothing seemed to remain
in them.</p>

<p>“Say, this is the same boat that fellow locked in
the boathouse, the time we were out rowing when
we met the Boxer Hall shell!” cried Tom, as he
saw the name on the bow.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” agreed Frank. “The very
same. Wallops said some boathouses had been
carried away. This must have been one of them.”</p>

<p>“I wonder who owns this boat?” ventured Sid,
but no one answered him.</p>

<p>They looked at the wreck for some little time
longer, and then started back up the river. They
had not gone far from the island before they met
a man rowing down in a small boat. He had an
anxious look on his face as he hailed them.</p>

<p>“I say, boys,” he called, “have you seen anything
of a wrecked motor-boat about here?”</p>

<p>“There’s one down on the point of that island,”
said Tom. “The <i>Sylph</i>.”</p>

<p>“That’s mine!” exclaimed the man. “Is there
anything left of her?”</p>

<p>“Not much,” replied Frank. “Wait, we’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
show you where she is. We were just looking at
her.”</p>

<p>“You were?” exclaimed the man, and there
was something in the sharp way he said it, and in
his tone, that caused the boys to glance at him curiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, saw it by accident,” went on Phil.</p>

<p>“Did you&mdash;er&mdash;find&mdash;that is&mdash;Oh, never mind,
I can soon tell when I look at her,” the man said,
rather confusedly, as he rowed on. The four lads
turned their craft and accompanied him.</p>

<p>“There she is!” cried Frank, pointing out the
wrecked craft amid some rocks and bushes. “You
can see for yourself there’s not much left of her.”</p>

<p>Without a word the man sprang ashore from
his boat, while the college lads kept their craft off
the rocks. Rapidly rummaging through the broken-open
lockers, the man, muttering to himself,
suddenly stood up. As he did so, Tom said in a
low voice:</p>

<p>“That’s the same chap who locked the boat up.
I wonder what is missing?”</p>

<p>“Did you&mdash;excuse me for asking&mdash;but <a href="#image02">did you
boys take anything from my boat?” asked the
man</a>, in rather hard tones.</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_30">“DID YOU BOYS TAKE ANYTHING FROM MY BOAT?”

</div>

<p>“Take anything? What do you mean?” demanded
Sid, sharply.</p>

<p>“Something is missing from one of the lockers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>“We certainly took nothing from your boat,”
said Tom, stiffly. “What is missing?”</p>

<p>“Many things,” was the answer. “Among
others, a number of trophy cups belonging to Boxer
Hall College. I had them to repair, polish and
engrave, and now they are gone from my boat.
Someone must have taken them!” and he looked
at the boys. The four chums felt their anger
rising.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>IMPLIED ACCUSATION</small></h2>


<p>Frank Simpson was the first to take definite
action. He looked sharply at the man, as the
latter gave the surprising information about trophies,
and then, in a low voice, said to his companions
in the barge:</p>

<p>“Let’s go ashore, fellows.”</p>

<p>“What for; to be insulted again?” asked Tom.
“I’m not going to stand for that fellow’s insinuations.
Who is he, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Frank, “and for the
very same reason that I, neither, do not intend to
stand for any imputation, I want to go ashore.
Give way!”</p>

<p>They urged their heavy craft shoreward.</p>

<p>“They are certainly gone,” went on the man,
as he continued to rummage about in the wreckage
of his boat. “And it means a big loss to me. If
you boys were here&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Say, just hold on a minute, my friend,” interrupted
Frank, in that cool way of his. “Just go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
a bit slow about making cracks. It might not be
altogether healthy!” and the eyes of the Big Californian
glowed.</p>

<p>“But I tell you it’s a big loss!” went on the
man. “I must find the things&mdash;money won’t pay
for them!”</p>

<p>“Now suppose we go at this thing systematically,”
suggested Frank, his chums, by common consent,
letting him assume the leadership. “We
don’t any of us know you, except that we all recall
seeing you land on the main shore in your motor-boat
a day or so ago. It was this same boat, I
take it.”</p>

<p>“The same,” answered the man. “And
now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Wait,” suggested Frank, holding up his hand.
“As for us, we’re Randall College students, as you
can easily verify. We’ll give you our names&mdash;fellows,
cards,” and Frank handed over one of his
own, the others doing the same.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” spoke the man, in half-sullen
tones; “but that isn’t going to bring back my
stuff.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we took it?” snapped Frank,
and there was a warning glint in his eyes.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;not exactly&mdash;but you lads were at my
boat, you say, and this is the first time I’ve seen it
since I left it with those cups and other valuables
in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, that’s a long way from proving that we
took anything,” went on Frank. “It’s laughable,
or, it would be if it wasn’t so serious.”</p>

<p>“Who are you, anyhow?” burst out Tom Parsons,
unable to restrain his curiosity longer. “This
thing is getting too deep for me. How did you
come to have the Boxer Hall trophy cups?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I had better explain,” went on the
man. “I am Edward Farson, and I’m in the jewelry
business in Haddonfield. I’ve only recently
started up, and I’m working a new line of trade.
I am an expert repairer and mender of old jewelry,
and I find that many residents along the river
here, as well as out in the country, have old jewelry
they want made into modern forms.</p>

<p>“As I happened to own a motor-boat I decided
to use that in making calls along the river, and I
have been quite successful. Then learning that the
colleges hereabouts had many cups and trophies
that grew tarnished, or were broken, I solicited
orders in that line. I also do engraving, putting
the names of the winners and all that on the cups.</p>

<p>“The other day&mdash;the time I remember now
when I saw you at Mr. Borden’s dock&mdash;I had collected
quite a few pieces of jewelry, some from
customers, some from the students at Fairview Institute,
and a number of trophy cups from Boxer
Hall.</p>

<p>“I had a call to make at Mr. Borden’s, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
leaving the jewelry and cups in a box in one of the
lockers of the boat, I ran my craft in the boathouse,
as you saw, locked it up, and went up the
hill to call on Mrs. Borden. As the box of valuables
was rather heavy I did not want to carry it
with me. I thought it would be safe.”</p>

<p>“We heard you remark as much,” interpolated
Sid.</p>

<p>“Yes? Well, I expected to be back right away,
but when I got to the house I found unexpected
news awaiting me. There had come a telephone
message from the clerk in my store, who knew that
I was to be at Mrs. Borden’s at a certain time. I
had told him to that effect, as my elderly mother
is very ill, and I wanted to be kept informed of
her condition. The doctor communicated by wire
with my clerk, and the latter left with Mrs. Borden
a message to the effect that my mother was
sinking, and that I was to hasten if I wanted to
see her alive.</p>

<p>“That, as you may suppose, drove from my mind
all thoughts of the valuables left in my boat. Or,
if I did think of them at all, it must have been to
hope that they would be safe, locked in the boathouse
as they were, and with no one but myself&mdash;as
I supposed&mdash;knowing of them.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Borden, whom I have known for some
time, as soon as she had given me the message
about my mother, offered me the use of a horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and carriage to get to my mother’s house, which
is quite a way back from the river, off in the country.</p>

<p>“I accepted and drove away, never even mentioning
to Mrs. Borden about the jewelry in the
locker of my boat. I said I would, on my return,
collect the things she wanted repaired. Then I
hastened to my mother.</p>

<p>“I found the dear old lady quite ill, and for a
time her life was despaired of. But she rallied,
and when my sister came to take charge of matters,
I decided to come back to my business. But,
in the meanwhile, as you know, there was the
flood.</p>

<p>“When I went back to the Bordens, it was to
find that their boathouse had been washed away
by the high water, carrying my craft with it down
to the lake. I was nearly crazy, not only at my
own loss, but over the missing valuables, which I
knew I could never replace. I borrowed a small
boat to-day, and set off in search of my launch. I
looked in several places where it might have
lodged, and when I saw you boys&mdash;well, you know
the rest,” and the jeweler concluded with a pathetic
air, as though his troubles was too much
for him.</p>

<p>“It’s rather a queer story,” commented Frank.
“As for our part in it, it is just as we told you.
We landed here by accident, and saw the wreck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of the boat. We assumed what had happened, but
we saw nothing of any box of cups and jewelry.
Then we rowed away and met you.”</p>

<p>“I’m much obliged to you for the information,”
said Mr. Farson, “and I&mdash;of course&mdash;I’m bound
to believe you,” he went on, a bit awkwardly.
“Then you didn’t see a trace of them?”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” cried Phil. “Don’t you believe
us?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes&mdash;yes, of course. I only thought that
maybe, as my boat is so broken up, and the parts
scattered about, that you might have looked
farther along the shores of the island. The box
may have held together, and be lodged somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it has,” said Frank, calmly. “I’d advise
you to look thoroughly. You might find it.
Come on, fellows,” and he led the way back to the
boat.</p>

<p>Tom Parsons acted as though he intended to
speak, but Sid nudged him in the ribs, and the
youth kept quiet.</p>

<p>Mr. Farson stared after the boys as though
much disappointed at their desertion, and then,
looking to the fastening of the rowing craft in
which he had come ashore, he began walking along
the edge of the island, where many signs of the
high water still remained.</p>

<p>“What did you want to come away for in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
a hurry?” asked Tom, in a low voice, when they
were some distance out. “You were on your high-horse
for fair, Frank.”</p>

<p>“And why shouldn’t I be? Do you think I was
going to stay there, and help him hunt, after he
practically insulted us the way he did? As if we
knew anything about his musty old jewelry!”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” broke in Phil. “I wouldn’t
lift my hand to help him, after he made that implied
accusation. We didn’t see any of his stuff!”</p>

<p>“Oh, so that’s the reason,” replied Tom.
“Well, I guess it was a good one, Frank.”</p>

<p>“Those Boxer Hall lads will be up in the air
all right when they learn that their trophies are
gone,” suggested Sid. “I wonder if there were
any of the ones they won in the last meet?”</p>

<p>“They didn’t get many,” chuckled Frank. “But
it will be quite a loss to them. However, it’s none
of our funeral. I wouldn’t trust any of my jewelry
to a man who would go off and leave it in a motor-boat
for a night and a day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, he didn’t mean to. When he got
that message about his mother, I suppose it flustered
him,” said Tom, in extenuation.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to blame him,” commented Frank.
“But he’s in a pickle all right. Now let’s do some
fast rowing.”</p>

<p>They hit up the pace, but they did not have
enough practice to maintain it, especially in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
heavy barge, and soon they were all panting, while
the oars took the water raggedly, and Sid caught
a crab that nearly sent him overboard.</p>

<p>“I guess we need some coaching,” admitted that
lad, when he had recovered himself. “We’re not
racers yet, by a long shot. Slow down a bit, fellows.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re too soft!” complained Frank.
“We’ll never amount to anything in a shell if we
can’t stand this. Think of a four-mile row at top
speed.”</p>

<p>“But we’ll be in better shape for it after a
course of training and some coaching,” declared
Phil. “Then, too, we’ll have this Summer vacation
to practice in.”</p>

<p>At slower speed they rowed up to their boathouse
dock, and were soon strolling across the campus
to their room, discussing the events of the last
few hours.</p>

<p>“I can’t get over the nerve of that jeweler!”
exclaimed the Big Californian. “He nearly got
me going.”</p>

<p>“I could see that,” commented Tom. “It was
a good thing we came away when we did.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, he wasn’t exactly responsible for
what he said. Be a bit charitable,” advised Sid.</p>

<p>“Well, how’s the racing game progressing?”
asked Holly Cross, as he met our friends. “When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
is that second-hand shell coming so we can practice?”</p>

<p>“That’s up to Dan Woodhouse,” explained
Tom. “Kindlings is chairman of that committee.
Let’s look him up.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if Boxer Hall will row us in the
Fall?” asked Bricktop Molloy, strolling up. “It
will make a double season for them.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they’ll dare refuse when we’ve
beaten them at almost everything else,” spoke
Frank. “But we’ll soon know about that. Dutch
Housenlager said he had written to their crew
captain and coach, and expected an answer soon.”</p>

<p>“They ought to be glad to row us,” commented
Tom. “It will give them a chance to get more
cups to replace those they lost.”</p>

<p>“How lost?” asked Holly Cross. “What do
you mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s a great story!” cried Sid, and he proceeded
to relate, aided by his chums, the incident
of the smashed motor-boat.</p>

<p>“Too bad,” commented Bricktop. “I know
how we’d feel if such a thing happened here. But
that fellow may find his stuff. Here comes Pete
Backus. Hi, Grasshopper!” he called, to a long
lad who imagined he was a champion jumper, “are
you going to try for the crew?”</p>

<p>“I sure am,” was the confident answer. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
used to row a lot when a kid, and I guess I haven’t
forgotten.”</p>

<p>“He’s too light by fifteen pounds,” declared
Frank, in a low voice. “About one hundred and
sixty is a good average.”</p>

<p>“Thank goodness we’re all of us that,” said
Tom, looking at the chums gathered about him.</p>

<p>“Are there going to be single races?” asked a
lad, stepping up to join the group. He was a well
dressed chap, reputed to be wealthy in his own
right. His name was Reginald Boswell.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, Reggie,” said Tom, in the drawling
tones affected by the other, “we count on having
single shells. Are you going to compete?”</p>

<p>“Aw, say, I wish you wouldn’t call me Reggie.
I hate that name!” exclaimed the lad, who was
completing his Freshman year. “Cawn’t you call
me just&mdash;er&mdash;Boswell?”</p>

<p>“How would Bossy do for short, me lad?”
asked Bricktop. “Not that you’re a calf, you
know; but Bossy has a sweet sound, thinkest thou
not so, my comrades?” and he appealed to his
chums with accompanying winks.</p>

<p>“Aw, I say now, quit spoofing me, cawn’t you?”
appealed the rich lad. “Bossy is too rotten silly,
you know,” and he drew a scented handkerchief
from the pocket of his rather loud, and swagger
clothes, which, as he always took the trouble to
inform all who appeared interested, were made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
“Lunnon.” Mr. Reginald Boswell had traveled
abroad, it seemed.</p>

<p>“You ought to be thankful for any nickname,
Bossy,” put in Holly Cross. “It isn’t every Freshman
who is thus honored. It’s going to be Bossy
or nothing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I say, Reggie isn’t as bad as that!”</p>

<p>“Bossy or nothing!” insisted Bricktop.</p>

<p>“Well, then, tell me about the single shells,”
went on the rich student, evidently deciding to accept
the less of two evils. “I’d like to row in those
contests.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you can&mdash;if you can make good,”
said Frank. “Come on, fellows,” and he linked
his arms in those of Sid and Tom, and walked
them off toward their dormitory, followed by
others of the chums, leaving Bossy, as he was generally
called after that christening, to contemplate
them with mingled feelings.</p>

<p>“Silly rotters!” he murmured after the manner
of some of his English acquaintances. “I’ll show
them I can row, though!”</p>

<p>The news of the loss of the Boxer Hall cups
was soon known all over Randall, and, in the next
day or so, it was generally talked of, for there was
a reward offered by the distracted jeweler, an article
appearing in the local paper about it.</p>

<p>“I guess he didn’t find any trace of them on
the island,” commented Sid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“The box is probably at the bottom of the
lake,” was Tom’s opinion.</p>

<p>It was several days after this that the four
chums were in Haddonfield, partaking of a little
supper after a vaudeville entertainment. There
strolled into the restaurant some lads from Boxer
Hall, among them one or two members of the
eight-oared crew.</p>

<p>“Hello, Dave!” greeted Tom and the others.</p>

<p>“Too bad about your trophies; wasn’t it,” added
Phil.</p>

<p>“Rotten!” conceded Dave. “Some of them
were old timers, too.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;er&mdash;I understand that you lads were the
<em>first</em> to discover the loss,” put in Harry Cedstrom,
one of the new students at Boxer Hall, and a member
of the crew. There was a strange emphasis
on the word “first.”</p>

<p>“The <em>first</em> to discover it&mdash;what do you mean?”
asked Frank Simpson, bristling up.</p>

<p>“I mean that you were first at the wrecked boat
that had held the box of jewelry,” went on Harry,
while some of his companions nudged him to keep
him quiet.</p>

<p>“We happened to be there,” admitted Frank,
in a quiet voice that, to his friends, always presaged
an outburst of righteous indignation. “We
saw the wrecked boat, and called the attention of
the owner to it. We went back with him, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
he told us his loss. That’s how we happened to
be the first, after Mr. Farson himself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” spoke Harry. “Then you were
at the boat <em>before</em> he was?”</p>

<p>“Cut it out; can’t you?” demanded Dave of
his friend, in a hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Frank quietly, “we were there before
Mr. Farson,” and he looked the other student
straight in the eyes.</p>

<p>“And you didn’t see anything of our cups?”</p>

<p>“Just what do you mean?” demanded Frank
quietly, half rising in his chair, while Tom laid
a hand on him in restraint.</p>

<p>“Oh,” went on Harry easily, “I thought maybe
you fellows might have taken our trophies&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” cried Frank, and he arose with
such suddenness that his chair overturned. Tom
arose also, and clung to the arm of the Big Californian,
whispering rapidly:</p>

<p>“Quiet, Frank. Keep quiet! Don’t have a
row here!”</p>

<p>“In a joke!” finished Harry Cedstrom with an
attempt at a smile. There was a dead silence in
the groups of students.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>THE CLUE</small></h2>


<p>Frank Simpson stared at the Boxer Hall lad
for a moment, and then sank back in the chair
which Sid Henderson had replaced for him. Harry
seemed to breathe easier, and certainly there were
looks of relief on the faces of his companions.</p>

<p>“A joke?” repeated Frank, grimly. “Well, if
that is your idea of a joke, all I have to say is that
your early education was sadly neglected. Fellows,
I guess it’s my treat. Some more of those
seltzer lemonades, waiter,” and turning his back,
with studied indifference, on the Boxer Hall lads,
Frank began to chat with his friends.</p>

<p>There was an uneasy movement among the students
from Boxer Hall.</p>

<p>“I tell you he insulted me!” Harry could be
heard to fiercely whisper, as he made an effort to
rise.</p>

<p>“Now you sit right still!” said Dave Ogden,
firmly. “If there was any insulting done, it was
on your part first. I tell you to drop it. Randall
is our rival, in more ways than one, but no one
ever yet accused her of unfair tactics&mdash;least of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
any of those fellows. You cut it out, Cedstrom,
or you won’t know what happened to you!”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” chimed in Pinky Davenport, another
Boxer lad. “That was a raw thing for you
to say, Cedstrom, and it might make trouble for
us.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care!” exclaimed the other, defiantly.
“I wanted to take those fellows down a peg. The
idea of them thinking they can row us!”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll give them all the chance in the
world,” declared Dave, good-naturedly; “but I
think they’ll never see the bow of our shell in an
eight-oared race. It takes more than one season
to turn out champions.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Pinky. “But you go a
bit slow, Cedstrom. Those fellows are good
friends of ours, even if they are rivals.”</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;no harm intended,” said the other,
seeing that he had gone too far.</p>

<p>Aside from uneasy glances from time to time
toward their rivals, our friends showed no further
interest in the unpleasant incident. It had not
come to the notice of others in the restaurant, for
the students were in a room that, by custom, was
set aside for their exclusive use.</p>

<p>“You got his number all right, Frank,” commented
Phil.</p>

<p>“That’s what,” chimed in Sid.</p>

<p>“Well, I wasn’t going to stand for any crack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
like that,” declared Frank. “Especially from a
Freshman. He may have meant it, and he may
not, but the time to put the screws on is in the beginning.”</p>

<p>The two parties broke up soon after that, most
of the Boxer Hall boys nodding friendly good-nights
to their rivals as they passed out.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Frank?” asked Tom, a
little later, as they gathered in their common study,
and the tall pitcher “flopped” down beside his
chum on the old sofa. At once there was a cracking,
splintering sound, and Sid cried out in alarm.</p>

<p>“Cheese it, you fellows! Do you want to spoil
that completely? Remember it’s an invalid.”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” cried Tom, getting off as
carefully as a skater goes over thin ice, while
Frank held his breath. “I didn’t mean to come
down so hard.”</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Oh, student spare that couch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touch not a single spring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sleep it resteth me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As nice as anything!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus Phil misquoted, adapting it to suit his
needs.</p>

<p>“Punk!” commented Tom.</p>

<p>“Fierce!” cried Sid. “That’s an old one.”</p>

<p>“Say, you fellows don’t know good poetry when
it comes up and shakes hands with you,” declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Phil, in disgusted tones. “I’m going to frame that.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to have a new frame for the couch
if Tom does any more of his gymnastic stunts,”
declared Frank, as he looked to see what damage
had been done. “The back’s nearly broken
again,” he added.</p>

<p>“Kindly forgive me,” spoke the pitcher, in contrite
tones. “But those two hulks have the armchairs,
and I wanted some place to rest. I guess
we’ll have to invest in another chair, if that couch
is only going to hold one.”</p>

<p>“We will not, you vandal!” exclaimed Phil.
“Sit on the alarm clock, if you want to, or flop
down on the floor, or to go to bed; but you don’t go
getting any new, modern, ugly, incongruous furniture
into this den.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t mean that,” Tom hastened to explain.
“I meant pick up a second-hand one somewhere.”</p>

<p>“That mightn’t be so bad,” admitted Frank.</p>

<p>“But say, what ails you, anyhow?” went on
Tom, turning to the Big Californian, as though to
change the subject. “I was asking you that when
they raised this row about the old couch.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you call that an ‘old couch’ unless in
terms of the deepest respect!” cried Phil.</p>

<p>“I meant it strictly in the Pickwickian sense,”
Tom hastened to explain. “But, Frank, is there
anything up?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, yes, there is,” admitted the other.</p>

<p>His chums looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>“I hope you didn’t take that Boxer Hall puppy’s
remarks seriously,” went on Tom.</p>

<p>“Not seriously, no; and yet what he said has
set me to thinking.”</p>

<p>“Hurray! Frank’s thinking at last!” cried Sid.
“Send word to Pitchfork, and he’ll give you a
double stunt in Latin.”</p>

<p>“No, but seriously,” went on the Big Californian,
“you heard what he said. In a joking way,
as I really think he meant it, he suggested that we
might know something of the missing cups and
jewelry, seeing that we were first on the scene&mdash;or,
at least, as far as is known. Now if he thought
that&mdash;even in a joke&mdash;and the jeweler thought it
seriously&mdash;as I am convinced he did&mdash;though he
soon passed it up&mdash;why shouldn’t other people?”</p>

<p>“Do you think they do?” asked Sid.</p>

<p>“They might, and what I’ve been thinking is
that we can’t afford to have even the slightest
suspicion hanging over us.”</p>

<p>“But does there?” demanded Tom.</p>

<p>“I don’t know&mdash;there’s a possibility that there
might. You see, fellows, we <em>could</em> have taken
those things!”</p>

<p>“We could!” cried Phil.</p>

<p>“Certainly. Just figure it out for a moment,”
went on Frank. “We might as well look at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
thing fairly and squarely. Say that box of jewelry
was in the wrecked boat when we found it on the
point of Crest Island. Say we found it to contain
the Boxer Hall trophies. We could have
taken them even for a joke; couldn’t we?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we didn’t,” declared Phil.</p>

<p>“No, but that won’t stop people from thinking
so. They may set it down as a college prank, but,
even so, they’ll think it just the same.”</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Sid, as Frank paused.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what I was thinking of when Tom
plumped down, and broke the sofa.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t break it.”</p>

<p>“You came mighty near it,” went on Frank.
“I was turning that over in my mind after what
happened in the restaurant, and I’ve got something
to propose.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” demanded Phil, leaning forward
so interestedly and suddenly that the old
armchair creaked and groaned dismally, and a
cloud of dust arose from its ancient upholstery.</p>

<p>“I think we ought to go back to Crest Island,
and make a search. We may find that box of cups
and jewelry caught in some cleft of the rocks, or
we may find&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Again Frank paused.</p>

<p>“What?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“A clue to who did take it&mdash;if it was taken.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, and then Sid
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Frank’s dead right! We’ll go to Crest Island
to-morrow and hunt for clues.”</p>

<p>Eagerly the matter was discussed, and in the end
all four agreed that they would make the search.
Then came an hour of studying, and the lights
went out.</p>

<p>“Oh, for the love of baked beans!” exclaimed
Tom, as they were all settled comfortable in bed.
“Somebody stop that clock, will you? I’ll furnish
the toothpick.”</p>

<p>“Get up and do it yourself,” directed Frank.
“I’m too comfortable.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” said Sid.</p>

<p>“Same here,” came from Phil.</p>

<p>“Then I suppose I’ve got to,” groaned Tom,
and in the end he did. Then, with the fussy, little
alarmer quiet, the chums dropped off, their
thoughts lasting longest on the prospective races,
and on the queer muddle of the lost trophies.</p>

<p>“Well, here’s where the boat was,” said Tom,
as they landed on Crest Island the next afternoon.</p>

<p>“But it’s gone now,” added Phil.</p>

<p>“Yes, probably Mr. Farson had it towed away
on a barge to see if he could save any of it. My
opinion is that it wasn’t worth it,” said Sid.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s scatter, two going down one shore
of the island, and two on the other,” suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Frank. “When the boat struck on the rocks, and
split, the things in the lockers may have floated
one way or the other.”</p>

<p>“If they didn’t sink,” put in Tom. “A box of
jewelry would be pretty heavy.”</p>

<p>“If it sank, so much the better,” declared the
Big Californian. “Then it would lodge, and when
the waters went down, as they did after the flood,
it would still stay there. Scatter and hunt.”</p>

<p>They took his advice, and for an hour or more
searched. Then Tom, who was with Frank, on
the eastern shore, sprang toward a clump of
bushes in which was caught some driftwood.</p>

<p>“I’ve found something!” he cried. “It looks
like the seat lockers of a motor-boat.”</p>

<p>“It is,” declared his chum, as he hurried to
Tom’s side.</p>

<p>There, in the debris that had settled around
the roots of the bush when the waters had subsided,
was part of a boat locker. It was split and
broken, but the cover was still on it. Eagerly Tom
lifted it and, as he did so he uttered a cry of delight.</p>

<p>“Here it is!” he shouted. “The jeweler’s
box! It has his name on it!”</p>

<p>“Open it!” exclaimed Frank, as Sid and Phil
came hurrying to join their two chums.</p>

<p>Tom lifted the cover.</p>

<p>“Empty!” he cried, blankly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>THE PRACTICE SHELL</small></h2>


<p>The four chums stared, almost uncomprehendingly,
into the open box. It was of good size,
capable of holding several trophy cups, with compartments,
velvet lined, for smaller pieces of jewelry.</p>

<p>“The things all fell out!” cried Tom. “They
must be scattered around here somewhere. Let’s
look,” and he started off.</p>

<p>“No use,” said Frank, quietly.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Tom, in wonder.</p>

<p>“Because those things never fell out of that
box,” went on the Big Californian.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t they?” demanded Phil. “When
the box was knocked around in the water, or even
inside the locker, why wouldn’t it be split open
and the things fall out?”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t split, as you can easily see,” went on
Frank, calmly, “and the cover wasn’t forced open
by banging against the rocks. It was opened by
some slender instrument being shoved under the
catch, and then pried upon. See, there are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
marks. No rocks ever made those,” and he
showed several scratches in the shiny surface of
the box, near the clasp. The scratches went entirely
under the broad brass fastener, showing
that something thin enough to have been employed
in this way was used. As Frank had said,
no rock against which the case might have been
tossed by the storm-waters, could have done it.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s take it to Mr. Farson,” went on
Sid. “We’ll tell him how we found it, and he
can then see that we had nothing to do with taking
the things&mdash;even in a joke. Let’s hurry back
to town.”</p>

<p>“Let’s do nothing of the sort!” exclaimed
Frank quickly.</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded his chums in chorus.</p>

<p>“If you want tongues to wag any more&mdash;if
you want a real suspicion to be cast on us, where
there’s only the faintest one now&mdash;if you want to
make real trouble, take that box to Mr. Farson.
If you don’t, and if you want to get at the real
facts in this case, just keep quiet about it.”</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence, and then Tom
objected:</p>

<p>“Well, maybe it’s clear to you, Frank, but I
can’t see it that way.”</p>

<p>“Me either,” declared Phil.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s as simple as anything,” declared the
Big Californian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, maybe it is,” admitted Sid, “but kindly
translate. It’s too deep for us.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” went on Frank. “That jeweler
saw us at the wreck; didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“No question about that,” admitted Tom.</p>

<p>“And we helped him look around. We were
here first; and we said we didn’t see anything of
the stuff.”</p>

<p>“No question about that,” admitted Sid, following
Tom’s lead.</p>

<p>“And now here we go and find the empty box&mdash;it
has every appearance of having been forced
open by human hands. We take it to Mr. Farson,
and say&mdash;‘Here’s your box, Mr. Jeweler; but it’s
empty&mdash;that’s just how we found it, honest it is!’
Say, wouldn’t he smell a rat right away, and think
we had the stuff?”</p>

<p>“No question about that,” declared Phil.
“That ends it! Frank is right, we’ll have to keep
mum about this for our own sakes, though I don’t
like it. It makes us look guilty.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” declared Frank, stoutly. “It
gives us a chance to find out who the guilty party
is.”</p>

<p>“Who do you suppose it is?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea,” answered the California
lad, quickly. “Someone may have been
on the island before we were, and found, and
rifled, the box; or that person may have come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
after we did. That’s one thing we’ve got to find
out&mdash;and it isn’t going to be any cinch, take it from
me!”</p>

<p>They all examined the box, and then looked
about the place where it had been found, for other
clues. But they found none&mdash;no other parts of
the wrecked boat seemed to be there.</p>

<p>As they were coming away, to get to their boat
and row to Randall, Tom stooped and picked from
the ground a bit of gaudily-colored silk, a plaid of
many colors, in a sort of ribbon.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Sid.</p>

<p>“Looks like part of a Scotch necktie,” replied
the tall pitcher.</p>

<p>“Let’s have a look,” suggested Frank, as he
closely examined the piece of silk. “That’s no
part of a necktie!” he exclaimed. “It’s a piece
of a Mexican silk handkerchief of all the colors of
the rainbow. I’ve seen ’em on sale out in my
state. The Mexicans and some other folks are
fond of sporting them, but they were always too
rich for my blood. But, fellows, do you notice
one thing about this?” and he held it up for inspection.</p>

<p>“Do you mean it might have been worn by the
jeweler, and dropped in his motor-boat?” asked
Tom.</p>

<p>“It <em>might</em> have been worn by the jeweler, but
not very likely,” said Frank. “In the first place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
notice that it shows no signs of having been wet,
except by the dew. It was never in the flood, or
it would have mud on it. And I don’t believe it
was worn by the jeweler, and dropped here; otherwise,
having good eyesight, as all jewelers and
watch repairers have, he would have seen his box.”</p>

<p>“Then you think&mdash;&mdash;,” began Sid.</p>

<p>“That it was dropped here by someone who
was on this island either before, or after, we were
here the first time; by someone who found the box,
opened it, and took the stuff away,” finished Frank.</p>

<p>“And who that person was it’s up to us to find
out,” declared Tom.</p>

<p>“Exactly. And here’s another thing,” went on
Frank, “this piece of silk is torn off in a long
strip, cleanly, and it looks to me as if it might
have been one of several so torn, or ripped, to
make a bundle of the cups and jewelry. If we
can find a handkerchief like this, with a strip torn
off, we’ll come pretty close to the person who has
the Boxer Hall cups,” finished the Big Californian.</p>

<p>“Maybe the fellow tore off a couple of strips,
used the main part of his handkerchief in which
to wrap his stuff, and left one strip here by mistake,”
suggested Phil.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” admitted Frank. “Well, we’ve got
about all we can find here, I guess. I vote we get
back, and talk this matter over among ourselves.
And, mind, not a word to a soul!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>All promised and then, carefully concealing in
their boat the jewelry box, with the piece of silk
inside, they rowed back to college.</p>

<p>But the discussion they brought to bear on the
matter in their room later, failed to throw any
light on the subject. All the conclusion they could
come to was that if they found the owner of the
gaudy handkerchief they might find the possessor
of the jewelry.</p>

<p>In the days that followed rowing matters occupied
much of the attention and the talk of the
Randall students. The chairmen of the various
committees called meetings, and made reports of
progress to the general athletic body. The offer
of the alumni to provide a fine boathouse, and a
rowing equipment, was formally accepted, and the
required promise made.</p>

<p>There was no lack of material for an eight-oared
shell&mdash;two in fact&mdash;several fours, a couple
of doubles, and one or two singles. In response
to a request for a list of what was needed, it was
decided to ask for one first-class eight-oared shell,
for two fours, two doubles, and three singles,
though the gift committee, naturally, would do as
they thought best. This would give plenty of craft
in which to practice. In view of the expense of
the eight-oared shell it was decided that the students
themselves would subscribe enough to purchase
a second-hand eight for practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>They learned of one in good condition, that
could be had at a bargain, also a single and a four,
and, as it would take some time for the generous
old graduates to provide their equipment, it was
voted to buy the second-hand ones for use the remainder
of that Spring.</p>

<p>“That will give us a little time for practice,”
decided Kindlings, who had the matter in charge.
He had been elected temporary captain of a tentative
eight crew; a temporary arrangement, as it
would not be known, until the coach had selected
the crew, who would row in the different craft.
There would be try-outs as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The old boathouse would have to answer until
the new one was built, but, to accommodate the
many students who now thronged it, a temporary
addition was built, the coming warm weather making
it unnecessary to have it very substantial.</p>

<p>The interest in rowing increased every day.
Our four chums and their friends were perhaps
the foremost in showing their delight in the coming
events.</p>

<p>Boxer Hall had been communicated with, as
had Fairview Institute, and both had agreed to
enter into triangular-league contests that Fall, the
details to be arranged later.</p>

<p>The second-hand shells had been ordered, and
Mr. Lighton agreed to do the water coaching, in
addition to looking after the baseball lads, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the affairs of the diamond were beginning to hold
the attention of many. Of course our friends did
not lose interest in baseball because of the coming
water sports.</p>

<p>Meanwhile no further trace of the missing cups
or jewelry had been found. No one claimed the
reward offered by Mr. Farson, to which the Boxer
Hall Athletic Association added a substantial sum
for the recovery of their trophies. Our friends
said nothing of their find, and, though there was
hardly a breath of suspicion against them, even
in Boxer Hall, still they fretted.</p>

<p>“We’ve just got to find out who took those
things!” cried Tom, one afternoon, coming back
from a row on the river.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” agreed his chums.</p>

<p>A number of the ordinary rowing boats had
been secured, and Mr. Lighton spent some time
giving the lads an idea of the rudiments of getting
down to the right stroke. Of course with toe
stretchers, and sliding seats, there would come a
vast change, so he did not want to go too deeply
into the matter until the right craft were at hand.</p>

<p>“Well, what shall we do this afternoon?” asked
Sid, as he yawningly tossed aside a book that he
had dipped into on coming to his room after a
lecture.</p>

<p>“I’m for a row!” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>“We ought to do some baseball practice,” suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Phil. “We’ve sort of been letting that
slide.”</p>

<p>“Let’s do a little of&mdash;&mdash;” began Frank, when
the door flew open, and in came Kindlings, all
excited.</p>

<p>“It’s come!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What?” chorused the others.</p>

<p>“The new shell&mdash;I mean the second-hand eight&mdash;the
boat we’re going to do our practice in! I
just got word from the freight office that it’s there.
Let’s get a truck, and have it carted to the river.
I’m crazy to get in and go for a row!”</p>

<p>“Hurray! That’s the stuff!” cried Tom.
“Come on, everybody!” and he led the way, the
others following.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>THE FIRST TRIAL</small></h2>


<p>“Well, now we have it, what shall we do
with it?”</p>

<p>“Say, but it’s a frail thing all right!”</p>

<p>“Looks as if one good stroke would split it in
two.”</p>

<p>“And that will hold eight men!”</p>

<p>“Nine, counting the coxswain, you gump!
Didn’t you ever see an eight-oared shell before?”</p>

<p>“Not so close at hand! Say, but it’s flimsy all
right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess we’ll find it stiff enough for us.”</p>

<p>These were only a few of the comments, and
questions, propounded by the students of Randall
as they gathered about the new shell&mdash;or, rather,
the second-hand one&mdash;that had been purchased in
order to give them practice while the new outfit
was being made.</p>

<p>Following the enthusiastic announcement of
Kindlings, as detailed in the last chapter, the more
eager of the rowing contingent, including our four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
heroes, had gone to the freight depot, and, procuring
a truck had, with great care and patience,
transported the boat, well swathed in burlap, to
the river. Later, under the direction of Coach
Lighton, they had attached the outriggers, gotten
out the oars, given the boat another coat of
varnish, oiled it well, and now it rested in the
water alongside the dock, as lightly as a swan, if
not as gracefully.</p>

<p>“It looks more like a water-spider than anything
else,” commented Jerry Jackson, one of the
Jersey twins.</p>

<p>“Here! Can that!” cried Tom. “No finding
fault with our boat, or we’ll duck you.”</p>

<p>“That’s what!” declared Dutch Housenlager.
“Let’s get in and take a try!” he proposed, starting
toward the frail craft, and preparing to step
in it.</p>

<p>“Here! Hold on!” cried Mr. Lighton, in
accents of alarm. “That’s no way to get into a
shell. Now you fellows just hold your breaths
until I give you a few points.”</p>

<p>The lads&mdash;a score or more&mdash;all of whom hoped
to make the eight, while others felt that they
would be satisfied in the fours, or singles, had
gathered around. They had all helped to get the
shell into shape, pending the arrival of some more
of the second-hand craft. Now they were eager
to try their skill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is too early to pick out the crew yet,” said
Mr. Lighton, “as I don’t know what any of you
can do. So I suggest that you all have a try, and
those that develop the most aptitude will come in
for more consideration. Have you thought of
anyone for permanent captain? Wait, though, I
guess you’d better let that go until you see how
you make out in rowing. And, as for the coxswain&mdash;who
wants to be coxswain?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Don’t all speak at once,” he added whimsically.
“Remember that, while it’s a post of honor,
the coxswain doesn’t row, though by steering he
assumes almost as much responsibility as all the
rest put together, for a well-steered boat often
means a winning one. We want a light weight for
coxswain,” and he looked over the assembled
group.</p>

<p>No one volunteered and the coach went on:</p>

<p>“Well, at the risk of seeming egotistical, I’ll
assume that post myself, for the time being,
though I’m a bit heavy. I think I can coach you
better from that position&mdash;at least at the start.
Now then, I guess we’re ready. Whom shall we
try first?”</p>

<p>Once more he looked around.</p>

<p>“Holly Cross,” he called, and that lad stepped
forward, then: “Kindlings, Phil Clinton, Tom
Parsons, Frank, Sid,” went on the coach.</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, come ahead, Housenlager,” said the
coach, as Dutch made an eager move. “Let’s
see, that’s seven. Where’s Bricktop. Not here.
Joe Jackson.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I’m a bit light,” said the Jersey
twin.</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps you are. You may fill in later,
though, as coxswain, or row in one of the other
boats. I guess&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’d like to row!” exclaimed someone.</p>

<p>Reginald Boswell stepped forward, a smile of
confidence on his face.</p>

<p>“I’ve done considerable of it,” he added, with
an air of assurance. To do him justice he was a
well-built lad, and those who had seen him out on
the river knew he could pull a good oar. Whether
he had racing qualities in him remained to be seen.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the coach, quietly. “We’ll
give you a trial. That makes the eight. Now
then, who’ll be for stroke? Simpson, I think I’ll
try you. You look as though you could set the
pace. For number seven&mdash;um! Parsons, you try
that, though we may change later. Remember
that number seven, who sits directly behind stroke,
has almost as important a position, for he has to
pick up the stroke promptly, and the rest of the
crew is dependent, in a great measure, on what
number seven does.</p>

<p>“Now, let me see. Boswell, you’ll be bow oar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Phil Clinton number two, Sid Henderson at three,
Housenlager at four, Woodhouse number five,
and Cross at six. Now I guess we’re all ready.
Steady the boat there, some of you, while the crew
gets in.”</p>

<p>Dutch Housenlager once more eagerly started
for the boat, and extended his foot to step down
into it at his designated seat.</p>

<p>“Wait! Wait!” cried the coach. “Don’t get
into a shell that way. Remember that it’s almost
as thin as its name indicates. Put your foot lengthwise
of the keelson, not athwart, or you may force
your heel or toe through the sides. Have all of
you your rubber-soled shoes on?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” replied Dutch, a bit abashed. A glance
showed that all were in sufficiently regular rowing
costume.</p>

<p>“Now, while we’re at it, I might as well tell
you how properly to get in a shell,” went on the
coach. “You may all listen, as you can’t tell
whom it may fit.</p>

<p>“In the first place take your oar, and, if you’re
to row on the side of the shell that happens to be
nearest the float at the time, lay your blade on the
platform. If you’re on the water side, lay the
blade flat on the surface of the water.</p>

<p>“Now get in, facing the stern, being careful
to step lengthways, as I told Housenlager. Stoop
down, with a hand on either gunwale, and lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
yourself into your seat. You will of course notice
the seats slide back and forth, that you have outriggers
instead of gunwale oarlocks, and that
there are stretchers, or loops under which to thrust
your toes.</p>

<p>“Once in your seat, ship your oar by thrusting
the handle in through the outrigger oarlock from
outside. Sit straight, not to one side, and squarely
face the handle of your oar, have your shoulders a
bit back, and your elbows close to your flanks.
I’ll give you more points as we go along.</p>

<p>“Hold your oar with the outside hand close to
the end of the handle, but not over the edge of it.
You get more power from your outside hand, remember.
The ‘outside’ hand, strange as it may
seem, is the one nearest the centre of the boat,
and the inside one, that nearest the ‘loom,’ spoon,
body or blade of the oar. Put the other hand not
more than two and a half inches from the outside
hand. Thumbs underneath, or toward the
bottom of the boat, of course; though some men
row with the thumb of one hand in the same
position as the fingers.</p>

<p>“And now then, to give you brief instructions
in how to row. First give a full, fair reach out
over your toes, with both arms perfectly straight,
dip your oar in the water&mdash;plunge it in with force.
Get a good hold on the water with the blade, and
the instant it is immersed, pull with all your might,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and then follow through, as we say, with a long,
firm stroke without vibration or wavering.</p>

<p>“Then, with a light finish, get your oar blade
clear of the water cleanly, feather light, low and
quick&mdash;into the water again all together with a
‘chug’&mdash;another pull and&mdash;there you are&mdash;you’re
rowing!”</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, and then Tom
remarked:</p>

<p>“Sounds easy; doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and some of you will find it easy,” remarked
Mr. Lighton, with a smile. “Others will
not. But we can tell soon who the rowers are going
to be, though that is not saying that, with
practice, some of those who seem the least fitted
may not become very proficient.”</p>

<p>“I once belonged to a swell New York club,”
remarked Reginald Boswell.</p>

<p>“Why did they put you out, Bossy?” asked
Kindlings, with a wink at Sid.</p>

<p>“They didn’t&mdash;I resigned,” and the rich lad
shot an indignant glance at his tormentor.</p>

<p>“Same thing,” remarked Kindlings.</p>

<p>“Now then, get into the shell, and we’ll try a
little spin,” called the coach, and he watched carefully
as each of the eight lads followed his instructions
more or less accurately. Some were a
bit awkward, but all were careful to at least step
into the shell properly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Push off,” commanded the coxswain-coach, as
he took his seat in the stern, with the tiller ropes
in his hands. “You will notice that some of you
are on what is called the stroke side&mdash;that is, with
your oars on the same side as Frank Simpson,
who faces me. So when I say ‘stroke side pull,’
it means that only those on that side, or at my
right hand, are to row.</p>

<p>“Oppositely, some of you are on what is known
as the bow side, or with your oars on the side on
which sits Boswell, the bow oar. That is on my
left. Though, of course, you all sit in the middle
of the boat. So when I give orders for the stroke
oars to do certain things I mean for those on
Frank’s side to obey. Now then, row, stroke
oars!”</p>

<p>Four blades shot back and took the water, not
all at once, as they should have done, but fairly
well for the first time. As the craft was heading
down stream, with the stroke oars nearest the
float, this manœuver tended to swing the craft
farther out into the river to clear the dock.</p>

<p>“Row, bows!” came the order, and the others,
dipping their blades, slewed the craft around until
she was straight again, and far enough out to
enable a good start to be made.</p>

<p>“Very good!” complimented the coach. “Now
then, row all!”</p>

<p>The frail shell, like some grotesque water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
spider, darted ahead, the water swirling under the
broad blades.</p>

<p>“Hurray!” yelled the crowd along the bank
and on the dock.</p>

<p>“They’re off!” shouted Jerry Jackson.</p>

<p>“The first spin!” added his brother. “I wonder
if we can turn out a winning crew?”</p>

<p>“Of course we can, Joe me lad!” cried Bricktop
Molloy, coming up at that moment. “Of
course that’s not sayin’ it wouldn’t be much better
with me in the boat, but it can’t be helped now.
I’m a bit late,” he added. “Ten thousand maledictions
on Pitchfork for detainin’ me. But who’s
that at bow?”</p>

<p>“Bossy,” some one told him.</p>

<p>“That calf! Sure he can row though!” the
Irish student added, half-admiringly, as he
watched the efforts of the rich lad.</p>

<p>The shell was well out in the river now, spinning
along at a rapid pace. Of course it was far
from being at racing speed, but even a little power
sent the knife-like boat along at a great rate, so
little resistance was there.</p>

<p>“Steady all!” called Mr. Lighton, in a low
voice, as he noticed a tendency to splash on the
part of some. “Get your oars in the water with
force. Get hold of the water all together. When
you do, it will sound like a stone falling in&mdash;a
chug&mdash;a noise like a ‘rotten egg’, as it is called.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Try for that. The eight oars ought to sound like
a single pair when you learn to row in unison.</p>

<p>“Pick it up a little faster, bow!” he called to
Boswell.</p>

<p>“This is the way I learned to row,” came the
retort from the bow oar.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll have to unlearn some things,”
retorted the coach, grimly.</p>

<p>“Don’t look so worried, Tom,” he went on a
little later. “You’re picking up your stroke fairly
well. Frank, a little more forward&mdash;reach out
well over your toes. That’s better. Now let’s
hit it up a little.”</p>

<p>They had been rowing about twenty strokes per
minute&mdash;rather slow, and, as Mr. Lighton indicated
an increase, Frank followed, until they were
doing twenty-four, a substantial advance. As they
rowed along, Tom glanced away from Frank’s
rising and falling back, and said in a low voice:</p>

<p>“Here comes Boxer Hall!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>RUTH’S LOSS</small></h2>


<p>“Silence number seven&mdash;eyes in the boat&mdash;on
the man in front of you!”</p>

<p>Thus the coach called to Tom, but there was no
sting in his words, and the tall baseball pitcher of
Randall knew that it was for the good of himself
and the crew. Nothing is so important in a race
as to save one’s wind, and to keep one’s eyes fairly
glued on the back of the man in front of one.
For on unison, and in rowing exactly in time with
every other man in the shell, does the race depend.</p>

<p>“Never mind Boxer Hall,” went on Mr. Lighton.
“We’re going to beat her, but we won’t
unless we learn how to keep our eyes in our own
boat. Steady there, Sid!”</p>

<p>On came the Boxer Hall eight. They were
rowing down the stream, as were our friends, but
the rival college shell was in the rear, having gone
up stream earlier in the day, being now on the return
trip.</p>

<p>“Don’t try to race them when they pass us,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
cautioned Mr. Lighton, who had not even turned
his head to see the approaching shell behind him.
“It will be a temptation, I know, but we are not
ready for a spurt yet.”</p>

<p>“Are we going to let them pass us?” demanded
the rich lad, almost forgetting to row.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk!” came sharply from the coxswain.
“It’s your business to row, Boswell, if
you want to be in this eight. You almost lost a
stroke then, and see how the boat slews! I have
to shift the rudder to correct it, and in a race that
might mean the loss of considerable distance.
Pick up your stroke, and don’t race!”</p>

<p>The face of the rich lad expressed disappointment,
and his was not the only one. Certainly it
was a bit galling to let Boxer Hall&mdash;their ancient
rival&mdash;pass them, and the first time Randall was
out in her eight, too!</p>

<p>But afterward all admitted the wisdom of the
course taken by the coach. They were in no condition
to race, and, green as most of them were as
to how to behave in a tricky shell, they might have
had an upset. Not they would have minded that,
but they would have been the laughing-stock of
Boxer Hall.</p>

<p>On came the rivals, the oars being feathered
beautifully. They took the water with that
peculiar chugging sound that always denotes a
well-trained crew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“Listen, all of you,” advised Mr. Lighton in a
low voice. “That’s what I mean by the ‘rotten-egg’
sound. It’s when the oar blade is plunged
under water as you begin your stroke. Try to
attain it&mdash;after they pass.”</p>

<p>The Boxer Hall lads, rowing perhaps a trifle
faster than they had been doing, sitting perhaps a
trifle straighter, and pulling a bit harder&mdash;a natural
showing off&mdash;came opposite the shell containing
our friends of Randall.</p>

<p>“Want to try a little spurt?” called Dave Ogden,
from the coxswain’s seat.</p>

<p>“No, thank you&mdash;we’re just out for practice.
It’s our first spin,” replied Mr. Lighton. “Some
other time.”</p>

<p>“Why not now?” murmured Boswell.</p>

<p>“Silence in the bow!” exclaimed the coach,
sharply.</p>

<p>“You’re a martinet!” retorted the rich lad, but
in so low a voice that only Phil, sitting in front of
him, heard.</p>

<p>Not a lad in the Boxer Hall shell spoke, though
several nodded in friendly fashion at their acquaintances
in the Randall boat. They were evidently
well trained, and were saving their wind.</p>

<p>On they rowed, passing those who hoped to
prove themselves formidable rivals by the following
Fall. And in spite of the command of Mr.
Lighton for all eyes to be in the boat, hardly a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
lad of the eight but glanced enviously at the
smoothly-swinging shell, that looked so trim and
so neat. For, in spite of the work expended on
the second-hand craft, it showed what it was.</p>

<p>“But it won’t be long before we have a better
one,” thought Tom.</p>

<p>“Row easy, all,” came the command from the
coach, when the Boxer Hall boat had passed
around a bend of the stream.</p>

<p>The stroke was slackened, to the relief of all,
for, though they were sturdy lads, rowing was a
form of exercise to which they were not much
accustomed, especially in a shell. The strangeness
of the seats, the toe stretchers, and the outriggers
added to their confusion, so that the fatigue was
almost as much one of attention and brain power
as of muscle.</p>

<p>“Now for a turn against the current,” remarked
the coach, when they had gone on a mile
or two more. “This will give you some resistance
to work against.”</p>

<p>The shell was turned, after a fashion, Mr.
Lighton being anxious not to bring too much
strain on the outriggers, the turning action always
involving this.</p>

<p>“Give way!” came the command, and the shell
started back up stream.</p>

<p>This was harder work, but the coach, desiring
to know if he had any members on the crew who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
were likely to prove of less service than the others,
kept them all up to a good stroke. There was
some panting when the float was reached, a larger
crowd than before being there to welcome the first
tentative crew. But, to do the lads justice, not
one but had stood the strain well, even the fault-finding
Boswell.</p>

<p>“Well rowed for the first time!” complimented
Mr. Lighton. “Now, then, a good shower bath
and a rub-down, and then some light exercise to
keep from getting stiff, for you have used muscles
to-day that seldom came into play before. Now
who’s for another crew?” and he picked out eight
more lads, who went off in the shell.</p>

<p>“That was great!” cried Tom, as, with his
three particular chums he started for the gymnasium.</p>

<p>“It sure was,” agreed Sid. “I never thought
I could do so well.”</p>

<p>“And I never knew I could do so rotten!” came
from Frank. “I used to think I was some pumpkins
with an oar, but this has taken all the conceit
out of me.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” agreed Phil. “But I think we’re
on the right road.”</p>

<p>“Boxer Hall did fine,” went on Tom. “I
give them credit for that. I wish we’d started
at rowing years ago. It’s a shame it was so neglected
at Randall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was dandy of those old grads to think to
put us in the way of it once more,” went on Sid.
“We’ll have to pass them a vote of thanks.”</p>

<p>Thus talking the boys went into the gymnasium,
whence they emerged a little later, glowing, and
feeling the spring and buoyancy of youth.</p>

<p>“Hello, what’s this?” asked Phil, as they entered
their room, and saw some letters on the table.</p>

<p>“From the girls!” cried Tom, as he saw a certain
hand-writing.</p>

<p>“Here, you’ve got mine!” declared Frank,
making a grab for the epistle in Sid’s hand.</p>

<p>“Beg your pardon old man&mdash;so I have. I’ll
trade,” and soon the four lads were busy perusing
four notes.</p>

<p>“They’re going to have a dance,” spoke Tom.
“A week from to-night. Will we go? I guess
yes! That is, I don’t think we have any date for
that evening.”</p>

<p>“If I have I’ll break it,” said Sid, quickly.</p>

<p>“Listen to the old misogynist&mdash;him as wouldn’t
used to speak to a girl!” cried Phil. “Oh, what
a change! What a change!”</p>

<p>“Dry up!” commanded Sid, making a reach for
his chum, who nimbly escaped by leaping behind
the sofa.</p>

<p>“Say, this is pretty indefinite,” went on Tom.
“They just ask us to come, and don’t say who’s
to take who, or anything like that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>“And there are a new lot of fellows at Fairview,”
said Frank. “I move that we go over and
make sure of our girls. I don’t want to get left.”</p>

<p>“I should have thought Ruth would be more
definite,” put in Phil. “But say, we’ve got time
to run over and back before grub. Come on.”</p>

<p>Regardless of the fact that they had just come
in from a hard row, they soon got into their “semi-best
suits,” as Sid called them, and hurried to the
trolley that would land them at the co-educational
institution.</p>

<p>“There are the girls!” exclaimed Tom, who,
being in the lead, as he and his chums crossed the
campus a little later, saw the four; Ruth, Madge
Tyler, Mabel Harrison and Helen Newton.</p>

<p>They paired off&mdash;as they always did&mdash;and soon
were walking in different directions. Tom was
with Ruth Clinton, and after the matter of the
dance had been settled, and she had agreed to accompany
him, as doubtless the other girls had done
for the other lads, the tall pitcher, with a glance
at his pretty companion remarked:</p>

<p>“New pin, Ruth? Where did you get it?” and
he looked at her collar-fastening.</p>

<p>“Hush!” she exclaimed, looking quickly
around. “Don’t tell Phil!”</p>

<p>“Why not?” Tom wanted to know. “Doesn’t
he want you to have jewelry?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but listen, you remember that dear old-fashioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
brooch I used to wear? The one with
the secret spring in the back, that, when you
pressed on it, showed a little picture of me. Do
you remember that?”</p>

<p>“Do I? I should say I did! And how you
dropped it at a dance once, and I had to crawl
down under the palms in the conservatory to get
it.”</p>

<p>“And you in your dress suit, poor boy!” and
Ruth laughed. “I should say you might well remember
it. But, Tom, this is serious,” and she
grew grave at once. “I’ve lost that brooch!”</p>

<p>“Lost it&mdash;how?”</p>

<p>“Or, rather, it’s been stolen, and I don’t dare
tell Phil. You know the clasp was broken, or
something was the matter with it. That’s the reason
it fell off that time you had to hunt for it.”</p>

<p>“And did it drop again? Tell me where, and
I’ll search until&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, Tom, it wouldn’t do any good,” and Ruth
sighed.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because it’s been stolen!”</p>

<p>“Stolen!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Listen. I feel dreadfully about it. You
know it was a gift from my grandmother. She is
a dear, old-fashioned lady, and she has lots of
lovely old-fashioned jewelry. She always said she
disliked the present styles, and when she gave me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
that pin she made me promise to wear it, and never
be ashamed of it, even if it was a century old.</p>

<p>“Of course I promised, for the pin <em>was</em> a
beauty. And grandmother always said that if I
took good care of it, and wore it whenever I went
out, she would leave me her lovely string of pearls.
Of course I would have worn the pin without that.
And now it’s been taken!”</p>

<p>“Taken! By someone here at college?”</p>

<p>“Hush, not so loud! I gave it to a jeweler, a
Mr. Farson, in Haddonfield, to repair the clasp,
and I just got word from him to-day that it was
taken. So I had to buy another pin to fasten my
collar with, and I’m so afraid Phil will notice it;
or that grandmother may hear about it! She’ll
say I’m careless.”</p>

<p>“Did Farson have your brooch?” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes. Why?”</p>

<p>“And did he tell you how it was taken?”</p>

<p>“Well, he said it was taken with a lot of other
things that he had collected from his customers to
repair. He offered to get me another, but of
course I never can get one like that.”</p>

<p>“Say!” exclaimed Tom, greatly excited. “Your
pin must have been in that box he left in his motor-boat,
when the craft was wrecked on Crest Island
and when the Boxer Hall cups were taken. By
Jove! This brings that robbery home to me all
right!” and Tom looked strangely at Ruth.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a><br />
<small>ON CREST ISLAND</small></h2>


<p>“What do you mean?” cried the girl, impressed
by Tom’s strange manner.</p>

<p>“Why, didn’t you hear? This jeweler had been
going about collecting work for repairing, and left
a lot of it in a box in his boat. Then he was called
away suddenly, and remained away over night. A
flood came up, swept his boat away, wrecked it on
Crest Island, and we four fellows found it there.
But the jewelry case was empty. Didn’t you hear
that&mdash;and about the Boxer Hall cups?”</p>

<p>“I believe I did,” answered Ruth, slowly. “But
I did not know then, that my brooch was in that
box. Oh, Tom, do you suppose it could be on
Crest Island?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Ruth. The box was empty when
we found it, and we think someone located it before
we did, and rifled it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom, my dear pin! If grandmother hears
I’ve lost it she’ll never forgive me&mdash;and then her
pearls, too; not that I care so much about them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
but this pin was given her by her husband, when
they were courting, and she thought the world of
it. It was made abroad, of a peculiar pattern, and
never could be replaced. It was an heirloom, and
she must have thought a lot of me to let me take
it.</p>

<p>“Oh, I just can’t bear to tell her it is gone!
Maybe we can find it. Perhaps it is on the island
yet. Maybe it dropped from the box. Tell me;
was Phil along when you found the box?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but of course he didn’t know that anything
of yours was in it.”</p>

<p>“Then please don’t tell him. He might think
I ought to tell grandmother about it&mdash;he’s so peculiar.
And I <em>will</em> tell her, if worse comes to
worst, and I can’t get it back. But, oh, Tom! do
you suppose it could be on the island?” and she
looked eagerly at him.</p>

<p>“If it’s there I’ll find it!” declared the tall
pitcher, perhaps with more zeal than discretion.</p>

<p>“And don’t you tell a soul!”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” he promised.</p>

<p>“Could you take me with you, Tom? I’d like
to help you hunt for it.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” he said, promptly. “The weather
is getting fine now. We’ll row over to the island
some day, and make a search. But that pin isn’t
going to be easy to find.”</p>

<p>“No, I realize that, Tom. But it will make me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
feel better to help look for it. Oh, how careless
of that jeweler to leave his things in the boat!”</p>

<p>“It was, in a way, but he could not tell he was
going to be summoned away, nor that the flood
would come. I feel sorry for him.”</p>

<p>“So do I, but&mdash;I want my brooch back,” and
Ruth smiled at Tom. “Now don’t say anything,
and don’t notice my new pin&mdash;at least in front of
Phil,” she stipulated. “If I can get the old one
back, then it will be time enough to tell him. Oh,
here he comes now, with Madge. Yes, I think the
dance will be perfectly fine!” exclaimed Ruth, in
loud tones, to change the conversation for the benefit
of her brother and Madge. Tom took his cue
instantly, and the four were soon engaged in a
lively conversation, Ruth, meanwhile, telegraphing
signals to Tom with her eyes, while she arranged
a bit of her lace collar over the new pin, so that
her brother would not notice it.</p>

<p>Plans for the dance being duly made, the boys
took a regretful departure. But it was high time, for
Miss Philock sent one of the teachers to Ruth and
the girls, to tell them that visiting hours were over.</p>

<p>“Until the next time!” called the girls, as the
boys walked off.</p>

<p>“And, Tom,” whispered Ruth, “don’t forget.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not!” he promised.</p>

<p>“Hello, what’s up between you and Sis?” asked
Phil, quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, we’re just arranging a little expedition,”
was the answer of his chum.</p>

<p>But Tom could not carry out his plan of taking
the girl to Crest Island the next day. It rained,
and baseball practice was ordered in the cage at
the gymnasium.</p>

<p>As I do not, in this book, intend to devote much
space to baseball at Randall (seeing that I have
fully discussed several games in other books of
this series), it is sufficient to say that all of our
friends played on the varsity nine, together with
some new students, and that Randall bade fair to
win the championship at this time. Which she
later did, though not without hard work.</p>

<p>Then came several days of practice in the eight-oared
shell, and in the four, the double, and singles,
which had, in the meanwhile, been received. There
was much enthusiasm, and Mr. Lighton had to
press in as coaches some post-graduate students
who knew rowing fairly well. But he himself gave
his time to the eight. A number of other lads had
been tried in it, and among those who had taken
the first practice spin several shifts in position
were made.</p>

<p>But at last a fine, warm, sunny Spring day came,
and Tom, after an early lecture one afternoon, arrayed
himself in a costume suitable for rowing,
and, with some cushions under his arm, set off for
the boathouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Whither away?” asked Phil, as he surveyed
his chum.</p>

<p>“Oh, out for a row,” and Tom strove to make
his voice indifferent.</p>

<p>“With cushions; eh? Want any company?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks, old man. No offense, of course,”
he hastened to add, “but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“None taken!” exclaimed Phil. “Guess I’ll go
get a girl myself.”</p>

<p>As Tom neared the boathouse he met Sid and
Frank.</p>

<p>“Want me to pull an oar?” asked the former,
as he saw the tall pitcher.</p>

<p>“No. I can manage,” and Tom proceeded to
get out a light boat.</p>

<p>“I say, old man,” put in Frank, with a wink at
Sid. “Lend me one of those cushions; will you.
I’m going&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You’re going to get one of your own!” interrupted
Tom. “I need these.”</p>

<p>“You mean the lady does,” added Sid, with a
laugh. “Go on, you old deserter. We’ll be going
out in the shell, later.”</p>

<p>“Will you?” exclaimed Tom. “I wonder if
I’d better&mdash;Oh, go and be hanged to you!” he
added. “I’ll get practice enough,” and he got
into the boat and rowed away.</p>

<p>“Wonder where he’s going?” spoke Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Give it up,” replied Sid. “Let’s find Phil, and
get ready for a spin.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tom made good time to Fairview,
and found Ruth awaiting him, he having previously
telephoned to her to be in readiness.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom, I wonder if we will have any luck?”
she exclaimed, as they set off, her three girl chums
watching her curiously.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” he answered, “but, really, I can’t
hold out much. A brooch is so small, and Crest
Island is rather large. But we’ll look near the
place where the box lodged. The pin may still be
there.”</p>

<p>It was not a short row to Crest Island, but Tom
did not mind it. Indeed he was rather sorry when
the place was reached.</p>

<p>He lost no time in proceeding to the spot where
he and his chums had picked up the jewelry box.
The place seemed just the same, with no evidence
of any other visitors. It was rather early for the
Summer crowds to come, and none of the several
cottages had opened.</p>

<p>The two spent some time in making a careful
search, beginning at the point where the wrecked
boat had been found, and working along both
shores&mdash;that is, after a search at the spot where
the box had been picked up. But no brooch rewarded
their efforts.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll have to wait until the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
things are located,” said Tom. “Your pin may
be among them.”</p>

<p>“Let’s walk on a little farther,” proposed Ruth.
“I want to look at Madge Tyler’s cottage.”</p>

<p>“Has Madge a cottage here?” asked the lad,
in surprise.</p>

<p>“Her people have taken one for the Summer.
Madge has invited us girls to spend several weeks
with her. Where are you boys going this vacation?”</p>

<p>“To Crest Island!” replied Tom promptly,
though, a moment before, he had had not the
slightest idea.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re just <em>saying</em> that!” challenged Ruth.</p>

<p>“No, really I’m not!” he insisted. “If you
girls are going to cottage here, I don’t see why we
can’t camp. Other fellows do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it would be nice, of course,” she admitted,
as they strolled along. “There’s the Tyler place,”
called Ruth a little later. “I recognize the description.
Isn’t it lovely?”</p>

<p>“Fine!” agreed Tom. “And that looks like a
good camping place,” and he indicated a spot not
far off.</p>

<p>They soon gave up looking for the lost brooch,
which, as Ruth said, was like searching for
a needle in a haystack. They strolled some distance
on the island, admiring the Summer cottages
that would soon be open, and then turned back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Not far from the spot where Tom and his
chums had found the rifled jewelry box Tom saw
a sort of shack, or small hut, off between the trees.</p>

<p>“I wonder whose that is?” he ventured.
“Let’s go take a look.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t seem very inviting,” returned Ruth.
“Perhaps some boatmen live there.”</p>

<p>The shack was deserted, but a look through the
grimy windows showed that it probably had an
occupant, for there were some dishes on a table,
some pans on a rusty stove, and, in through another
room, could be seen some bunks.</p>

<p>“Probably a caretaker for the cottages,” suggested
Ruth, as she rested her hand on a window-sill,
and idly pulled out some threads that had
caught in a splinter. “Rather a strange sort of
caretaker,” she went on, “who wears silk&mdash;see,
these are silk threads,” and she held up a number,
brightly colored.</p>

<p>“Where did you get those?” asked Tom, and
the girl started at the strange note in his voice.</p>

<p>“On the window sill,” she explained. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;nothing,” was his answer, but she noted
that he took the threads from her, and carefully
put them in a card case. “They might do to make
a fishing fly with,” he explained, after a pause.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said.</p>

<p>They strolled around to the front door of the
building to find it locked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s someone’s card,” remarked Ruth, as
she touched a bit of pasteboard with the toe of her
shoe. “Maybe it was on the door, telling at what
hour the person who lives here would return.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” agreed Tom, stooping to pick it up.
“I’ll fasten it back again. I wonder who does live
here?”</p>

<p>Idly he turned the card over. Then he started
in surprise, for the name that met his eyes was:</p>

<p class="noic"><i>Reginald Boswell</i></p>

<p>“Who is it?” asked Ruth. “Anyone I know?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I fancy not,” answered Tom, still staring
at the card. “I wonder how that got here?” he
mused. “And I wonder who lives in this shack?”
and putting the bit of pasteboard in his pocket, he
swung around.</p>

<p>“I guess we’d better be getting back,” he said
to Ruth. “It’s getting late, and it’s a bit of a
pull. I’m sorry we couldn’t find your brooch.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” she admitted, with a sigh. “But it
can’t be helped. Oh, <em>how</em> can I tell grandmother?”</p>

<p>She took Tom’s arm, as the way was rough.
They had not gone many feet before they heard
someone approaching, tramping through the underbrush.</p>

<p>“Who can that be?” asked the girl.</p>

<p>“I don’t know&mdash;we’ll look,” whispered Tom.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />
<small>THE GAY HANDKERCHIEF</small></h2>


<p>“Who are you&mdash;what you do here?”</p>

<p>The question was snapped out at Tom and Ruth
as they stood near the shack. A man had come to
an abrupt halt as he emerged from the bushes and
faced them; something of fear, Tom thought,
mingled with anger showing on his face. It was
this man whom they had heard approaching, a
man clad in ordinary garments, yet with an indefinable
foreign air about him&mdash;an air that was
accentuated by his words and inflection. He was
dark of skin, swarthy, and when he smiled, which
he did a moment after his rather harsh words of
greeting, his very white teeth showed beneath a
small black moustache. A Spaniard Tom put him
down for, or a Mexican. The latter guess proved
correct, as the lad learned afterward.</p>

<p>“You come here to&mdash;to&mdash;pardon, senor, I am
forgetting my manners,” went on the fellow with
a bow, and a sharp glance at Ruth. “You are
here perhaps to look at cottages&mdash;you and your
charming bride.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Ruth drew in her breath sharply, and a rosy
glow suffused her face. She did not look at Tom,
who chuckled audibly.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I’ll never speak to you if you do that
again,” said the girl, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Do what?” asked Tom, innocently enough.</p>

<p>“Laugh at&mdash;at what he said,” and she still
blushed, and refused to look up.</p>

<p>“Pardon, senor,” went on the man. “No offense,
but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Tom easily, master of
himself now, but wondering much who the man
might be. “We were just looking around. Some
friends of ours have a cottage here&mdash;the Tylers&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Then you are very welcome. In
fact you would be welcome anyhow, as this island
is more or less of the public&mdash;what you say, I
have not the very good English?” and he looked
questioningly at them.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean that it is open to the public.”</p>

<p>“That is so, yes, senor, and senorita. You are
interested in my poor abode here&mdash;yes?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we were just looking around,” explained
Tom. “We did peep in. No harm, I hope.”</p>

<p>“None at all, senor.”</p>

<p>“I’m from Randall,” the pitcher went on.
“Miss Clinton is from Fairview.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are fellow students then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not exactly&mdash;say, rather&mdash;rivals,” and Tom
looked at Ruth and laughed. The blush had somewhat
subsided.</p>

<p>“Ah, I comprehend. I am Rafello Mendez, at
your service, senor.”</p>

<p>“My name is Parsons,” went on Tom. “Sorry
I haven’t a card,” and he thought of the one he
had picked up, which he had quickly thrust into his
pocket at the sound of approaching footsteps.</p>

<p>“I am what you call the take-care man around
here,” went on Mendez. “I am the take-care man
of the cottages&mdash;not all&mdash;some.”</p>

<p>“The ‘take-care’ man,” murmured Tom. “It
sounds like the bugaboo-man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he means the care-taker,” exclaimed Ruth.
“I understand. You look after the property
while the cottagers are away; isn’t that it?” and
she smiled at the man, who bowed low and answered:</p>

<p>“The senorita has said it. I am the take-care
man.”</p>

<p>“But I thought old Jake Blasdell had that job,”
said Tom. “I know he used to be here. But I
never knew he had this shack, though I haven’t
been much on this part of the island.”</p>

<p>“Senor Blasdell did was the take-care man,”
explained Mendez. “But he was took sick, and
had to leave, and a friend got me the place. Me,
I used to be of the sheep take-care in my country&mdash;Mexico,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
but I long for this country and I come.
I do what you call a business on the edge.”</p>

<p>“On the edge?” murmured Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, senor, on the edge. Or maybe you say on
the point. You see he is like this: I am the take-care
man for the cottages in place of Senor Blasdell
in Winter. In Summer I am the cut-the-grass-man
or the garden-man, what you like. Then,
besides, in addition, on the edge I sell things in
my store which it is unfortunately not open now,
or I should show the senorita some pretty things.
The store I do on the edge&mdash;or maybe on the
point, I know not how you say,” and he shrugged
his shoulders expressively.</p>

<p>“Oh, he means on the side!” cried Ruth.
“Don’t you understand, Tom? He is a caretaker,
and at odd times he sells things to the Summer
cottagers.”</p>

<p>“The senorita has said it,” went on Mendez.
“It is on the side, not on the edge&mdash;pardon!”</p>

<p>“What do you sell?” asked Tom, curiously.</p>

<p>“Everything. Things from the country. Of
a specialty I have the beautiful Mexican push-work,
senorita.”</p>

<p>“Push-work, that’s another new one,” said
Tom.</p>

<p>“I guess he means Mexican drawn-work,” explained
Ruth with a smile. “Some of it is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
beautiful. He ought to do a good business here
in the Summer.”</p>

<p>“I should, if I had all customers like the
senorita,” said the man with a bow to Ruth, again
showing his white teeth in an expansive smile. “I
am covered with confusion that I can show her
none now. But it is all put away. Perhaps,
though, if you wait&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, we must be moving on!” interrupted
Tom. “It is getting late. And so you live here
all Winter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, senor. This little hut was part of the
place where Senor Blasdell used to stay. It was
donated to me. I moved it here when I succeeded
Senor Blasdell, and added to it. It is very comfortable.
I have been over to the main land for
some supplies, and when I come back I see you.
At first I am suspicious, for which I ask your pardon.
You are always welcome, the senor and
senorita,” and again he bowed.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Mr. Mendez,” said Tom, rather
carelessly, for somehow he did not like the fellow.
“We may see you this Summer. Some of us fellows
may camp here.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall be pleased to show you some fine
Mexican leather work. Perhaps a lariat, spurs,
bridles, and some fine silver work for the pretty
senoritas, is it not?” and the fellow smiled genially.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-bye!” called Tom. “Come along,
Ruth. I’ll have to hit up the oars going home or
I’ll have you so late that you’ll get on the bad
books of the Ogress.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m there already,” she replied, as she
nodded to the Mexican, who bowed low in farewell.
“All our crowd is, but we don’t mind.
Now, Tom, did you really mean what you said
about going to camp on Crest Island this Summer?”</p>

<p>“I do, if I can get the other fellows to do it.
I know they will, too, for we’ll be near our rowing
shells, and we can have the best kind of practice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is <em>that</em> the only reason you want to come
here?” and she looked archly at him.</p>

<p>“Why, isn’t that&mdash;&mdash;” he began and then a
light dawned on him.</p>

<p>“I guess we wouldn’t come if you girls weren’t
to be here,” he added, quickly. “When I tell the
fellows that, I know it will cinch matters. Oh,
we’ll come all right.”</p>

<p>They reached their boat, embarked, and Tom
was soon sculling away from the island.</p>

<p>“Queer chap&mdash;that Mendez,” remarked the
youth after a bit.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he?” agreed Ruth.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know those Mexicans were so
thrifty,” the rower went on. “Being a ‘care-take’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
man and doing Mexican ‘push-work’ on the
‘edge’. Pretty good; eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed Ruth. “I can see where we
girls will spend a great deal of our time this Summer.”</p>

<p>“So can I,” declared her companion, boldly.
“With us fellows.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re not at all conceited; are you?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it,” went on Tom, tantalizingly.
“But say, do you know I didn’t much like that fellow,
for all his fine airs.”</p>

<p>“Why not, pray? I thought him quite polite.”</p>

<p>“He was&mdash;altogether too polite,” murmured
the lad, with a little more force than seemed
necessary. “I don’t like foreigners, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Well, I could forgive anyone, even a foreigner,
if I could get back my brooch,” sighed Ruth. “I
don’t know what I’m going to do about it.”</p>

<p>“It is too bad,” agreed Tom. “Now, Ruth,
we won’t say anything about what happened to-day,
and if you promise not to tell, I’ll whisper a
secret.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom, of course I won’t tell&mdash;you know
that!” and she looked reproachfully at him.</p>

<p>“Of course&mdash;I was only joking. Well, we four
fellows are trying to do a little detective work,
and recover the stolen jewelry.”</p>

<p>“You are?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and if we do we may get back your
brooch.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I hope you do!” and she clapped her
hands in spontaneous delight. “Do you think
you will, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Hard to tell, Ruth. There aren’t many clues
to work on. At least there weren’t until to-day&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, did you find some to-day, Tom? Tell
me, I’m so fascinated with detective work! Did
you really see some clue that escaped me?”</p>

<p>“Ahem! Detectives never talk about their
cases, or tell about their clues!” he exclaimed,
with exaggerated gravity.</p>

<p>“Tom Parsons!”</p>

<p>“Well, really, I don’t know whether I did find
a clue or not, Ruth. I’m going to think about it
over night. If you can help me I won’t hesitate to
call on you.”</p>

<p>“Will you, really, Tom? That’s good of you.
And now I’m afraid you’ll have to row a little
faster. It <em>is</em> getting quite late.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed the lad, as he bent to the
oars. As he rowed his thoughts went to the card
in his pocket and to the strands of silk from the
gay handkerchief.</p>

<p>Fortunately Ruth was not so late that Miss
Philock found fault. Tom proved himself a good
rower, though after he had said good-bye he took
the course easy on the way to Randall.</p>

<p>“Some sculling,” he told himself, as he tied up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the boat and, in the dusk of the late Spring evening,
walked toward his room. “This ought to
stand me in good stead for the eight. My muscles
are hardening,” and he felt of his biceps. He was
in extraordinarily good training from his baseball
work.</p>

<p>As he was about to enter the building where he
and his chums had their rooms, he saw Boswell
approaching. Tom’s mind flashed to the card he
had picked up at the shack.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he could have been doing
there?” the tall pitcher mused. “If Mendez
didn’t have his store open and his stock ready for
sale, how could Bossy have bought any? And, if
he didn’t go there to buy anything, why did he go
at all? I give it up.”</p>

<p>There was no time for further speculation just
then, as the rich lad, with a nod, addressed Tom.</p>

<p>“Where were you?” he asked with an air of
familiarity that Tom rather resented in a Freshman.
“We had a fine row in the eight. I’m
almost sure of bow, and Lighton may shift me to
stroke, or number seven.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” questioned Tom indifferently, yet resolving
to make a brave struggle not to let this
usurper put him out of his place in the boat.</p>

<p>“Sure thing. I’m coming on fine, and I’ve got
a dandy scheme for keeping in trim this Summer.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. Our folks are going to take a cottage
on Crest Island, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You are?” and Tom fairly exploded the
words.</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know, though it’s a beastly
slow and unfashionable place. We usually go to
the shore. We have one cottage there, and
another in the White Mountains, but I persuaded
dad to take one at Crest for the Summer, just so
I could be near the water here and get familiar
with the course we’ll row next Fall. Nothing like
knowing the course, old man, really.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not,” and Tom’s mind was
busy with many things. With Boswell on the
island, matters might not be so pleasant as he
had anticipated.</p>

<p>“That’s right. I’m going to get a professional
coach, too.”</p>

<p>“You are?” Tom’s voice was still indifferent,
but Boswell did not notice it.</p>

<p>“Sure thing. When I go in for a thing I go
in hard, and I’m going into this rowing game for
keeps.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope we all do,” and Tom tried to be
pleasant as he turned away.</p>

<p>“See you later,” murmured the Freshman, in a
patronizing tone, and, as he turned aside he drew
from his pocket a gaudy handkerchief. At the
sight of it Tom stared, for it was the same pattern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
as the strip of silk found near the looted jewelry
box. Tom stared at it intently as the rich lad
flourished it.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” suddenly exclaimed Boswell, “I’ve
got that torn handkerchief again,” and he held it
up, showing where a strip had evidently been
ripped from it. “I’ve got two,” he explained,
“and this one got torn the other day. I thought
I laid it aside, but, in my hurry, I must have
grabbed it up.”</p>

<p>“How&mdash;how’d you tear it?” asked Tom, when
he could trust his voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, it caught on a nail down at the boathouse,
and a piece was ripped off.”</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why couldn’t you have it sewed on?”
asked Tom.</p>

<p>“What? Carry a mended handkerchief? I
guess not. Anyhow the piece fell in the water and
floated away. Hope you’ll be in the eight next
time we practice, though I may get your place.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” answered Tom, and he did not take
the trouble to designate which clause the word
modified.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>THE FIRST BREAK</small></h2>


<p>“Say, where in the name of Diogenes’s lantern
have you been, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Yes, come in you musty old deserter, and
give an account of yourself. You’ve been away
so long that you must have forgotten the counter-sign.”</p>

<p>“It was a girl, fellows&mdash;I can smell the perfumery!”</p>

<p>Thus Sid, Phil and Frank greeted the advent
of our hero into the common room, soon after he
had left Boswell. Tom’s brain had been so busy
with so many thoughts, after the sight of that
torn handkerchief, that he had eaten scarcely any
supper, though his appetite just before that had
been of the best.</p>

<p>“Shove over; can’t you?” was all Tom said to
Phil, who was stretched out on the old sofa.</p>

<p>“Sure I can. What’s the matter? Got a
grouch!”</p>

<p>“No, but I’m dead tired.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“Be careful how you flop,” warned Sid, as he
watched with anxiety Tom’s preparations to sit
down. “That sofa doesn’t gain strength with
age&mdash;it isn’t like cheese in that respect.”</p>

<p>“Where were you?” asked Phil, as Tom managed
to find a resting place without bringing forth
from the sofa more than a protesting groan, and a
series of squeaks.</p>

<p>“Ruth and I were out for a row,” said Tom
shortly, knowing that the truth would out sooner
or later, and having nothing to conceal.</p>

<p>“Oh, ho!” exclaimed Sid.</p>

<p>“Where’d you go?” asked Phil, with brotherly
interest.</p>

<p>“Crest Island. That’s what kept me so long.
I got her home in good season though, and rowed
slow the rest of the way.”</p>

<p>“Crest Island!” exclaimed Frank. “Did you
find any more clues, Tom?”</p>

<p>The tall pitcher hesitated. He was in two
minds about what had taken place that afternoon.
Should he tell his chums the secret he thought he
had discovered, and get their opinions in working
it out? Or should he play a lone hand? A moment’s
thought convinced him. He would tell all&mdash;that
is, all save Ruth’s secret. That he had no
right to divulge.</p>

<p>“Well?” asked Frank, as his chum hesitated.
“Did you find anything, Tom?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“I sure did, fellows,” and he tossed on the table
the card of Boswell, and the strands of silk.</p>

<p>For a moment no one spoke, and then Sid, picking
up the card remarked:</p>

<p>“This looks suspicious, Tom. Did you and
Bossy quarrel over a girl, and go to Crest Island
to have a duel? It begins to look that way&mdash;exchanging
cards and all that.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t exchange cards,” said Tom shortly.
“I found that card near a shack where a caretaker
lives. And, by the way, fellows, we’re going
to camp on Crest Island this Summer.”</p>

<p>“We are?” cried Phil.</p>

<p>“I like the nice, easy way he has of laying out
our vacation plans for us,” remarked Sid.</p>

<p>“Just as if he was our manager,” added Frank.</p>

<p>“Well, I only thought it would be handy if we
want to practice rowing,” went on Tom, holding
back the other reason. “We could get a boat,
and drop down to college here every day or so,
take out the shell and have a spin. If we want to
beat Boxer Hall we’ve got to do some tall
hustling, and practice like all get-out!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I fancy I can practice rowing on Crystal
Lake, where our folks intend taking a cottage,”
said Sid. “No Crest Island for mine!”</p>

<p>“The girls are going to cottage there,” went on
Tom, with a fine appearance of indifference.
“Madge Tyler’s folks have a neat little shack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
there, and Ruth, Helen and Mabel are going to
spend some time with her.”</p>

<p>“They are!” cried Frank.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you say so at first?” asked Sid,
indignantly.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;er&mdash;I guess I can fix it to camp there,”
spoke Phil, just as if he had never intended spending
his vacation at any other place.</p>

<p>“Oh, you fellows were so sure you knew your
own business that I didn’t want to butt in,” went
on the pitcher. “But, boys, what do you think of
that?” and he indicated the card and silk.</p>

<p>“It’s the same material,” spoke Frank after a
bit, as he compared the shreds Tom had pulled
from the window-sill of the shack on the island,
with the torn strip found near the looted jewelry
box.</p>

<p>“And what would you say if I told you that
Bossy had a handkerchief of that same pattern,
with a strip torn off?” asked Tom, slowly.</p>

<p>“Has he?” asked Frank, looking sharply at his
chum.</p>

<p>“He has.”</p>

<p>“Then, by crimps! He’s the fellow who has
the cups and jewelry!” cried Sid.</p>

<p>“Go easy,” advised Phil. “That’s the worst
of you&mdash;always jumping to conclusions.”</p>

<p>“And why shouldn’t I, when I can land on ’em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
as easily as I can on this one? Isn’t it as plain
as can be?”</p>

<p>“Not altogether. We’d make fine specimens
of ourselves if we went and accused him on this
evidence. You say, Tom, that you found this
card near the Mexican’s shack?”</p>

<p>“Yes. And the shreds of silk there, too. It
looks to me as if Bossy had been there to buy a
handkerchief. Two of ’em, if we’re to believe
him. The Mexican probably has them as well as
his ‘push-work’ as he calls it,” and he told all the
circumstances of the visit to the island, omitting
only the search for Ruth’s brooch.</p>

<p>“I guess that part is right,” admitted Frank.
“I mean about Bossy going there to buy one of
these gay handkerchiefs. But just because he did
doesn’t make him guilty. In fact, what object
would he have in taking some trophy cups that he
could get very little for if they were melted up,
and nothing for, if he tried to sell them as they
were? No one would buy them, for on the face
of them they show what they are. Some were engraved
with the Boxer Hall fellows’ names. And
the other jewelry wasn’t so very valuable. Bossy
wouldn’t have any object in taking that. He’s
got more money now, than is good for him.”</p>

<p>“He might have been gambling, and gotten
short of cash, and been afraid of asking his folks,”
suggested Sid, remembering an ordeal he had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
through in having a relative under similar circumstances,
as I related in “Batting to Win.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” declared Frank. “To my
mind I’d sooner suspect this Mendez. He seems
a fishy sort of character.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think he’s straight,” declared Tom. “I
made some inquiries about him while I was having
grub. It seems some of the fellows here have
been buying stuff of him&mdash;last year when he was
traveling around the country. He bears a good
reputation, and Hendell’s father, who owns part
of Crest Island, was telling me that the property
owners looked up his record well before they let
him succeed old Jake Blasdell as caretaker.”</p>

<p>“Hum!” mused Frank. “It doesn’t look as
easy as it did at first, in spite of these clues, Tom.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Say, I’m not as much of a detective
as I thought. I wonder if that jeweler
could be double-crossing us?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Sid.</p>

<p>“I mean could he have lost the box of jewelry
overboard before his boat was carried away by
the flood? If he did, he could make up the story
that he left it in the locker, and that someone else
got it when the boat was wrecked.”</p>

<p>“That’s possible, though not probable,” admitted
Frank. “Fellows, my advice is that we
put these things away, and forget all about them
to-night. In the morning we may see matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
clearer. I’ve got to do some boning anyhow.
Put ’em away, Tom.”</p>

<p>Soon only the ticking of the fussy, little alarm
clock was heard, mingled with the rattle of paper
as books were leafed or as the lads wrote out
their lessons. Even the clock stopped after a bit,
and the sudden silence was so startling that Phil
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“She’s run down! Hope nothing’s the matter
with her,” and he picked up the timepiece with an
anxious face.</p>

<p>“Probably got toothpickitis,” suggested Tom.
“Give it a shake.”</p>

<p>Phil did so, with the result that a piece of toothpick
did fall out, and then the clock went on ticking
again.</p>

<p>“That’s better,” sighed Phil, though often he
had objected to the incessant noise. “It would be
like losing an old friend if that went back on us.”</p>

<p>He settled into the depths of one of the old
armchairs, Sid being in another, while Frank, who
had succeeded to the sofa stretched out luxuriously
on that, having ousted Tom, who, on a stool
drawn up to the table, was making an ancient war
map that was to be used in class the next day.</p>

<p>Morning brought no clearer view to the puzzling
problem of the clues to the missing jewelry,
and, having all agreed to keep silent about the
matter, the lads laid aside the articles and hurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to chapel. In the several days that followed
nothing new in that line developed.</p>

<p>There came several baseball contests, in which
Tom and his chums distinguished themselves. The
long vacation was approaching, and more or less
“boning” had to be done if the lads intended to
pass their examinations. All these things, with the
rowing practice, kept them busy so that Tom, as
was the case with the others, had little chance to
see the girls.</p>

<p>The other second-hand rowing craft were made
good use of, and those who were to go in the four
were practically picked. So were the singles and
doubles, though of course a change might be made
in the Fall, when new material would come to
Randall.</p>

<p>All eyes, and most of the interest, however,
was on and in the eight. On this Randall built her
hopes of becoming champion of the river and
lake league. Though when word came of the fast
time made by Boxer Hall and Fairview in their
practice spins, there were doubtful shakes of the
head, for Randall was nowhere near as good.</p>

<p>Then came the annual Boxer Hall-Fairview races.
It was about an even thing between the two colleges,
until it came time for the eight-oared contest.
There was even a tub race, and the boys at
Randall decided to have one when it came time
for them to take part in the regatta.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>But Boxer won the eight with ease over Fairview,
and when Mr. Lighton, who with most of
those who had practiced in Randall’s big shell,
witnessed the exciting finish, he shook his head.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to do some tall hustling,” he remarked,
“and make some changes. I’ll start in
on them to-morrow.”</p>

<p>There was a larger number than usual at practice
on Sunny River the next day. All Randall
seemed to be at the boathouse. Adjoining the old
one a start had already been made on erecting the
new structure, presented by the alumni. Word
had been received that the new shells would be
ready in ample time for the Fall races.</p>

<p>“Young men!” exclaimed Coach Lighton, as
the eight was slipped into the water, “I’m going
to make some radical changes in the crew, and I
want none of you to feel sore, because, you know,
it is for the good of the college. We have not
been rowing well, of late, and there are several
faults to correct. The boat hangs a bit, and is a
trifle heavy by the stern. She drags. I know one
reason for this, it is my own weight, and so I am
going to suggest that you now try one of yourselves
as coxswain. I am a little too ‘beefy’ for
the place.</p>

<p>“Jerry Jackson, you take the tiller ropes.
You’ve had more practice than any of the others,
and you’re too light to hope to be at the oars.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Jerry, cheerfully. After
all it was an honor to steer the eight.</p>

<p>“Simpson, you’ll stay at stroke, and, Parsons,
I’m going to send you back a bit. No offense, but
you’re not quite quick enough in picking up the
stroke. I think it’s your baseball arm that’s at
fault. Molloy, you take Parsons’ place, and Tom
will go number three. From three, Henderson
will go to bow. He’s about the right weight for
there when we get Jackson in as coxswain. And,
Jerry, you’ll want to shift your seat a bit aft, to
make up for the extra weight they’ve been carrying
in me. That will make a good change, I
think.”</p>

<p>There was some murmuring over the changes,
and obviously nearly all were pleased. Molloy
especially, for he had been fretting lest he be kept
out of the eight. As for Tom he was rather glad,
on the whole, that he did not have the responsibility
of picking up Frank’s stroke, for it was a
responsibility, and it was telling on him. He had
begun to realize that his baseball pitching had
made him a bit awkward in one arm.</p>

<p>“Say, where do I come in?” suddenly asked
Boswell. “I was at bow, and now&mdash;I’m nowhere,
Mr. Lighton.”</p>

<p>“I’ll work you in another crew, Boswell,” said
the coach, sharply.</p>

<p>“But I want to be in the varsity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“This isn’t the varsity any more than any other
collection of eight rowers is. The varsity isn’t
picked yet, and won’t be until the Fall.”</p>

<p>“Well, this looks very much like the varsity to
me,” sneered Boswell. “All the fellows in it are
on the varsity nine&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That’ll do you!” said the coach, snappily.</p>

<p>“Then I’m not to row at bow?”</p>

<p>“Not in this eight.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t row at all!” and, with a fierce
glance at the selected rowers, the rich lad turned
sharply and walked off to the dressing rooms.</p>

<p>“The first break,” murmured Tom.</p>

<p>“Take your places,” spoke the coach, quietly.
“I’m going to follow you in the launch. Jackson,
make ’em do as you tell ’em!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>A FRIENDLY BRUSH</small></h2>


<p>There was a small motor-boat, the property of
the rowing association at Randall, having been acquired
since the new interest in racing, and several
times Mr. Lighton had used it to coach the lads
in the fours, singles or doubles, running alongside
of them. He now proposed to make use of it to
coach the eight, since this was the first time (save
for a few practice runs of short length) that he
had not acted as coxswain. In the latter tries Jerry
Jackson had steered, and, as he owned a motor-boat
of his own, which he ran every Summer, he
was an apt pupil.</p>

<p>Little was said of the changes made, until the
shell was well out in the river, and then Phil, who
was, in the new arrangement, next to Tom, remarked:</p>

<p>“How do you like it, and what do you think
of it?”</p>

<p>“I think Bossy was a calf to show his temper
that way, and I like it here better than in the stern.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
I can row better when I don’t have to worry about
picking up Frank’s stroke.”</p>

<p>“Say, but he’s a peach at it!” exclaimed Sid,
admiringly, from his place at bow oar.</p>

<p>“Silence in the bows!” came the sharp command
of Jerry Jackson.</p>

<p>“Listen to him,” spoke Bricktop, who was at
number seven.</p>

<p>“That won’t do, boys!” came the sharp voice
of the coach, as he ran his little launch up alongside.
“If you’re not going to accord to Jackson,
while he is in the position of coxswain, the same
respect you gave me, you might as well give up
rowing now and for all. You can’t talk and row.
You need too much breath for the latter. So if
you want to talk, and gibe the coxswain, then the
place for you is on shore.”</p>

<p>“Right!” exclaimed Sid. “I’ll be good.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” came from Tom.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, coxswain,” said Phil.</p>

<p>Bricktop Molloy, grinning while the sweat ran
down from his forehead, outlined in red hair,
into his eyes, whispered:</p>

<p>“What you say, goes!”</p>

<p>And then Bricktop, being as loyal a Randallite
as there was, proceeded to row as he had never
before, while Frank set a killing stroke. The
little lesson was not wasted.</p>

<p>Running along in the launch, by means of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
he could keep close to the shell, Mr. Lighton gave
valuable advice. He could do it to better advantage
now that he was not in the boat.</p>

<p>“Cut ’em down some,” advised the coach, after
Frank’s little spurt. “About twenty-eight a minute
will do now. We’ll try a ten-mile bit to-day.”</p>

<p>Some of the lads felt their hearts sink at this.
Eight had been the limit so far, but they realized
that they were in for a grilling, and they stiffened
their backs to it.</p>

<p>“Row out your strokes,” went on the coach.
“Use every ounce of strength you have, and remember
that your muscular force, applied at the
beginning, does ten times the work as if you put
it in at the end. Keep together. Get the oars in
the water at the same time, and out together.</p>

<p>“Feather a bit higher&mdash;the water is rough to-day
and you don’t want to splash. Try to imagine
you are all a part of one man rowing in a small
boat. Make your oars rise and fall together.
They’re a bit ragged now.”</p>

<p>With such good advice did the coach urge on
the lads, and they responded nobly. In a short
time, though the rowing had gone a bit awkwardly
at first, there was a noticeable improvement.</p>

<p>As Mr. Lighton had said, the boat had been a
bit heavy aft, and had dragged. With his weight
gone, and with a lighter coxswain, and with the
other changes, there was great improvement. Instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of hanging in the water the shell seemed to
glide through it at a steady rate. There was no
jerking progress, but a steady onward movement,
the perfection of rowing.</p>

<p>“Get a little more into the finish of the stroke!”
called the coach at one point. “You must get the
beginning of the stroke with the body only, but
finish with the arms and shoulders. Send your
elbows past your sides. Drop your shoulders, but
keep up your heads and chests.”</p>

<p>Thus he corrected fault after fault, until on
the return from that row not a lad but felt he
had made great improvement. They were all
grateful for the change, even Tom, who had been
shifted from the post of most honor, next to the
stroke. Of course, Boswell, who, like Achilles,
sulked in his room, could not be expected to be
happy.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a fair thing,” he declared to his
chum, Elwood Pierce. “I ought to have been
kept at bow, or they might have made me stroke.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, old chap,” agreed Elwood.
“But what can you expect of such beastly rotters?
It wouldn’t be that way over in Oxford.”</p>

<p>Rumor had it that Pierce had tried to enter
Oxford, but had failed miserably. He always declared
that the English climate did not agree with
him.</p>

<p>The Randall eight was within a few miles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
their boathouse when the rowers saw approaching
around the bend of the stream the Fairview eight,
swinging along at a good pace. Instantly there
came into the minds of all the same thought.</p>

<p>Mr. Lighton who was alongside, must have
realized it, for he called out:</p>

<p>“I won’t mind if you have a brush with them,
if they’re willing. But don’t get too excited or
anxious over it.”</p>

<p>“Ready!” called Jerry Jackson.</p>

<p>Not get excited! As well tell a racehorse not
to gallop when he hears the pit-pat of hoofs behind
him. The hearts of all quickened.</p>

<p>On came the Fairview eight out for a final practice
spin. Their season was over, but they were
keeping in training for the races in the Fall.</p>

<p>“Want a brush?” asked Jerry of Roger Barns,
who was coxswain.</p>

<p>“Sure!” came the reply. “And we’ll give you
a start.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want it!” snapped Tom. “Even
terms or nothing!”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” murmured Frank, as he took
a tighter grip on his oar.</p>

<p>The two eights were now on even terms. Mr.
Lighton, with a final nod of encouragement,
steered his craft out of the way.</p>

<p>“Give way, boys!” cried Jerry, as he grasped
the tiller lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“Show ’em how we row, even if Boxer Hall
did beat us!” called Roger.</p>

<p>With eager strokes the lads took up the race,
and, though it was but a friendly brush it meant
more to Randall than any realized, save those
thinly-clad lads in the shell. It was their first
chance to see what they could do against a formidable
rival.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />
<small>THE LONG VACATION</small></h2>


<p>“Come on now, fellows! Hit her up!” exclaimed
Jerry Jackson, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“No, not yet!” whispered Frank, as he bent
forward in his place at stroke until he was nearer
the lad at the tiller ropes. “Feel ’em out first,
Jerry. Don’t go breaking our hearts in the first
mile. We’ve got a good ways to go in this little
race, and the spurt will come toward the end, if
I’m not mistaken. It would be pie for them if we
rowed ourselves out, and then they would simply
spurt past us. They’re older hands at it than we
are.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right, Frank,” admitted Jerry,
who took the advice in good part.</p>

<p>He had not been acting as coxswain long enough
to feel resentment that his orders were not obeyed.
He realized, also, that the lads at the oars had
all the work to do, and, as it was not a regular
race, when the coxswain had to be the general, it
was no more than fair that the ones who had to
do the labor should have a voice in saying how it
was to be done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait until we&mdash;get into a&mdash;good swing. Let
us pull at&mdash;this stroke&mdash;for a while,” went on
Frank, speaking rather jerkily, and whispering
every time his head came close to Jerry, in leaning
forward to make his stroke. “Watch ’em,
and when&mdash;you think we can spurt&mdash;then give&mdash;the
word.”</p>

<p>“All right,” assented the coxswain. He looked
over at the Fairview shell, and noted that Roger
Barns, the coxswain, was closely regarding the
Randall eight.</p>

<p>“They’re sizing us up,” thought Jerry. “Well,
we may not be such a muchness now, but by Hector!
When we start in regular training this Fall,
if we don’t make ’em sit up and notice which side
their tea is buttered on I’m a Dutchman, and
that’s no wallflower at a dance, either!” and
Jerry shut his lips firmly and felt delicately of the
tiller lines, shifting the rudder slightly to learn
that the shell was in good control. She responded
to the lightest touch, being indeed a well-built
craft and as light as a feather, though with sufficient
stiffness&mdash;that quality always hard to get
in a frail shell.</p>

<p>The two racing machines were now moving
swiftly along, being about on even terms. Now
and then, seemingly in response to a signal from
their coxswain, the Fairview lads would hang back
a bit, allowing the Randall shell to creep up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Evidently it was a little trick, played with the
hope that Randall would spurt, and give her
rivals an opportunity to sweep ahead of them in
splendid style, thus winning the impromptu race.
If such was the intention Randall did not bite at
the bait, for Frank, in a few whispered words to
Jerry, advised him not to signal for a quicker
stroke.</p>

<p>“Say, is this a race or a crocheting party?”
grumbled big Dutch Housenlager. “Vat you
t’ink, Kindlings.”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking that&mdash;I’m&mdash;getting winded,”
panted Dan Woodhouse.</p>

<p>“Silence up there!” exclaimed Jerry, sharply.
“It isn’t a talking match, whatever else it is!
You’ll get all the race you want pretty soon.
We’re coming to a good stretch and I think
they’ll hit it up there. Be ready for the word,
fellows.”</p>

<p>“Say, boys, he talks; but he won’t let us!”
complained Bricktop, winking at Jerry.</p>

<p>“That means you!” insisted the coxswain. He
glanced ahead. The launch with the coach had
speeded off and was some distance up the river
now, evidently waiting for the finish of the little
brush.</p>

<p>The talk in the Randall eight had been carried
on in low tones, for sounds carry wonderfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
clear over water, and the lads, realizing this, did
not want their rivals to hear them.</p>

<p>Jerry stole another glance at the Fairview eight,
and, unconsciously, probably, nearly every Randall
man did likewise. The result was some uneven
and ragged rowing, and a bit of splashing.</p>

<p>“Eyes in the boat!” came the sharp command
from the little coxswain.</p>

<p>“Oh, you tyrant!” breathed Bricktop Molloy,
but his smile took the sting from the words.</p>

<p>An instant later Jerry detected a movement in
the rival shell.</p>

<p>“The spurt is coming!” he reasoned. “We
must be ready for it!”</p>

<p>He hesitated but an instant, and then, as he
noted Roger Barns straighten up slightly in his
coxswain seat, and take a fresh grip on the tiller
ropes, Jerry called:</p>

<p>“Ready boys! Hit her up. Thirty to the
minute!”</p>

<p>At once the Randall shell shot forward almost
as though raised from the water, for the oars
caught evenly and every man fairly lifted himself
from his seat, to urge the craft ahead.</p>

<p>“Come on, now!” cried Jerry. “Keep it up!”</p>

<p>He swayed his body to indicate the time of the
stroke, and he was pleased to note that all the
lads in the shell were rowing in unison. The
blades of the oars dipped well&mdash;not too deeply&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the feathering, while it might have been better,
was fair for a raw crew. Jerry stole one look
over to the Fairview eight, and noted that he had
not been mistaken. They, too, had spurted at
the same time. Randall had not been caught
napping.</p>

<p>For several minutes this kept up, and Fairview
could not seem to shake off her rival, and shoot
ahead. Then a command could be heard given
in that shell. What it was Jerry could not catch,
but he saw the time of the Fairview rowers
quicken.</p>

<p>“Can you stand another stroke or two, boys?”
he asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>Frank nodded without speaking. Indeed his
breath, as well as the breath of his companions,
was all needed for the work.</p>

<p>“A little livelier,” ordered Jerry, and he added
two more strokes to the minute.</p>

<p>Of course the effect was not so great as before,
but it told, and Fairview, which had begun creeping
ahead, was held in check by Randall.</p>

<p>Another minute passed, and then the superior
training and practice of Fairview told. Slowly
she forged ahead, and nothing the Randall lads
could do could prevent it. They were at their
limit now, or at least the limit to which Jerry
dared push them. With straining eyes he shot a
quick glance across, and noted with despair that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Fairview was a good quarter of a length ahead.
Another minute and she was a half.</p>

<p>“One more stroke!” pleaded the coxswain,
and Frank nodded desperately. Slowly Randall
began creeping up again, but it could not last.</p>

<p>And then came a narrow turn in the river, a
rather dangerous place with cross currents.</p>

<p>“Easy all!” called Roger Barns, and his crew
ceased rowing. It was a signal that the impromptu
race was over.</p>

<p>“Easy all!” commanded Jerry, with a sigh
that they had not won. But at that Fairview was
only a scant quarter of a length in advance. Randall
had been beaten, but not by much.</p>

<p>“Congratulations!” called Roger to his rival
steersman. “You’re coming on, Randall.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll beat you in the Fall,” retorted
Jerry, cheerfully.</p>

<p>“We’d have walked away from you if it hadn’t
been the tail end of the season,” declared Hadfield
Spencer, the Fairview stroke. “We’re not
in training.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t crawl,” said the coxswain. “They
rowed a good race.”</p>

<p>And this was praise indeed, from no mean
rival, and from the coxswain of a crew that had
given Boxer Hall, the river champions, a hard
race.</p>

<p>“Well done, boys! Well done!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Coach Lighton, as he came puffing up in his
launch. “You did better than I expected you
would. Fairview, we’ll be ready for you in the
Fall.”</p>

<p>“We’ll take you on all right,” replied Roger
Barns, with a genial laugh.</p>

<p>“And you steered exceedingly well, Jackson,”
went on the coach, as the Fairview shell pulled off.
“I was afraid you would spurt too soon, but you
held yourself well in.”</p>

<p>“I was watching the other fellows,” said Jerry.</p>

<p>“That’s the way to do,” was the comment.
“Now take it easy to the float.”</p>

<p>There was talk all through Randall that night
of the performance of the eight.</p>

<p>“I think we have just the right crew now,”
confided the coach to Dr. Churchill, when he went
to dine with the venerable head of Randall.</p>

<p>“Ah, I am exceedingly glad to hear that. It
will be a source of gratification to the alumni who
have so generously provided for the racing material.
And you say our boys nearly won from
Fairview? How many innings did the game go?
What was the score, and did Parsons pitch?”</p>

<p>“Ah&mdash;er&mdash;my dear Doctor,&mdash;er&mdash;we were
talking about the crew,” said the coach, delicately.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, so we were,” admitted the good doctor,
in some confusion. “I was thinking of football,
was I not? And so we have a good crew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Hum! Very well. I am so occupied with my
translations of those Assyrian tablets that I fear
my mind wanders at times.”</p>

<p>At times! Ah, Dr. Churchill, more often than
“at times” did your mind wander! But what of
that? It was keen enough on all occasions,
though running in various channels, as many an
old graduate will testify.</p>

<p>The practice at Randall went on. There were
sore hearts, but it could not be helped when the
lads who thought they should be picked for the
tentative crews, or for the singles, were passed by.
For Mr. Lighton was impartial, and insisted on
only the best no matter at what cost.</p>

<p>Perhaps sorest of all was Boswell, he who had
been displaced from what had come to be regarded
as the varsity eight, though, as the coach
pointed out, there might be changes in the Fall.
Boswell was ordered into what was termed the
“second” eight, but refused to go.</p>

<p>“I may not row at all,” he said loftily to his
crony, Pierce. “Or I may go in the singles.”</p>

<p>“I would,” suggested the latter. “My word!
A man’s his own boss in a single.”</p>

<p>“I’ll think of it,” replied Boswell.</p>

<p>Examinations came, with all their grilling and
nerve-racking tendencies, and were more or less
successfully gotten through with by our friends
and their chums. Then came the long vacation.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>OFF FOR CAMP</small></h2>


<p>“See you soon again, old man!”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll get together in a couple of weeks.
I’ve got to spend some time with the folks.”</p>

<p>“I’ll write when I have the camp site all arranged
for.”</p>

<p>“And don’t forget to plan for plenty of grub!”</p>

<p>“I want a soft cot, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Say, what about the girls? I suppose there’s
no doubt about their going to Crest Island?” and
Sid Henderson, who asked this question, interpolating
it among half a dozen others, as well as
amid numerous interjections, looked anxiously at
Tom, as the four chums were saying good-bye
preparatory to dispersing for the vacation.</p>

<p>“Of course they’ll go,” declared Tom. “I
had a letter from Ruth to-day&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You did?” cried Phil. “I’ll have to have a
little seance with Sis. She writes to you oftener
than she does to me, of late. Tom, you rascal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
take care!” and he shook a warning finger at his
chum.</p>

<p>“And hark to Siddie, would you!” mocked
Frank. “Sid’s so anxious about the girls that he
won’t play if they don’t come; will you Siddie?”</p>

<p>“I’ll play my fist on your nose, you old allosaurus!”
cried Sid, as he made an unsuccessful
reach for his tormentor.</p>

<p>Books had been put away in the study of our
heroes. The armchairs had been covered with
dust-cloths, as had the creaking old sofa; the
alarm clock had been wrapped in cotton, and put
on the shelf. Its tick would not be heard until
September. It would have a vacation, too.</p>

<p>Randall College began to take on a deserted air,
but there was still some activity around the boathouse.
The shells were to be kept ready for use&mdash;the
eights, the fours and the singles. For Mr.
Lighton had urged all, who could, to come, if
only for an occasional spin on the river to keep
in condition.</p>

<p>As we know, our friends had arranged to camp
on Crest Island, and from there, as they had a
boat, they could take a run down to Randall, and
get in a four for practice. If they could get four
others, and someone to act as coxswain, they
would also row in the eight, they told the coach.</p>

<p>“An excellent plan,” he declared. “It will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
give us a good crew for the eight in the Fall, I’m
sure.”</p>

<p>“The only drawback about Crest Island,” said
Phil, “is that Bossy is going there. He’ll be an
unmitigated nuisance, if I’m any judge of human
nature.”</p>

<p>“Especially if he does as he says he will, and
takes to practicing in a single,” added Tom.</p>

<p>“But the island is big enough,” added Sid.</p>

<p>“Even if the cottage his folks have taken is
near the Tylers’,” put in Frank, with a grin.</p>

<p>“Is it?” asked Sid, eagerly.</p>

<p>“It sure is.”</p>

<p>“Then he’d better look out!” declared Sid.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Afraid he’ll take your
girl?” asked Tom, with a laugh. But Sid did not
reply.</p>

<p>Nothing more had been discovered about the
missing jewelry, nor had Tom and his chums been
able to follow the clues which they had stumbled
upon. The torn handkerchief, the empty jewelry
box, the shreds of silk, had been put away, together
with Boswell’s card. Mendez, the Mexican,
had been seen around Haddonfield several
times since Tom and Ruth had met him on the
island, and he seemed to be selling his wares,
there being little need of his remaining on the
island as caretaker all day. Whenever he met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Tom, he was very polite, but our hero cared no
more for the swarthy man than he had at first.</p>

<p>“He’s altogether too nice,” decided our hero,
though he realized this was nothing against the
man. Certainly there seemed to be nothing to
point suspicion to him, any more than to Boswell,
and the four chums did not dare make an untoward
move. It was too risky, Frank said.</p>

<p>As for the Boxer Hall lads, though some might
have held a faint thought that their Randall rivals
were responsible for the loss of the cup trophies,
no one said so in that many words. Still many
Randallites felt that a grim suspicion hung over
the college, caused by the unfortunate fact that
Tom and his chums had been first on the ground
when the articles were discovered to be gone from
the wrecked boat.</p>

<p>“Hang it all!” exclaimed Tom, as he and his
chums were about to separate for the vacation, to
meet soon again, “I wish we could get on the
trail of that stuff, and the man who took it!”</p>

<p>“So do I!” added Frank. “Well, maybe
something will turn up this Summer.”</p>

<p>As for Ruth, she had successfully kept her
secret with Tom. If her girl friends noticed the
absence of her old brooch they said nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. Farson, the jeweler, fretted much over his
loss, but it did no good. He even increased the
reward, to no more purpose. It all remained a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
mystery. He did not even know as much as the
boys did about the affair, and, for their own reasons,
the students kept silent.</p>

<p>Our four heroes dispersed to their homes, to
meet warm welcomes there. Then came preparations
for going camping on Crest Island. The
Tyler cottage was opened by some of the servants
and put in shape for Summer occupancy. Madge
wrote to Ruth, Mabel and Helen, bidding them
get ready to come when she sent word.</p>

<p>Tom spent a week or two at the shore, “recuperating,”
as he put it, from the hard study incidental
to the examinations.</p>

<p>“I guess, more than likely, it’s to rest from the
hard work of pulling in that shell,” said his father,
grimly.</p>

<p>Frank Simpson went on a short trip to his beloved
California, and Phil and Sid put in two
weeks at various Summer resorts.</p>

<p>Finally the time came to go to camp. Tom,
who was in charge of most of the arrangements,
sent out letters to his chums bidding them assemble
at his home, as he was nearest to Randall College.</p>

<p>And, one fine morning, with their baggage
gathered, and with their camping paraphernalia
sent on ahead, they departed.</p>

<p>“Off for Crest Island, and the mystery!” exclaimed
Tom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not so loud!” cautioned Frank.</p>

<p>“Say, rather,” interpolated Sid, “off for Crest
Island and&mdash;the girls!”</p>

<p>“Hark to the lady-killer!” mocked Phil.
“Talk about your Beau Brummels!”</p>

<p>“Punch him for me, Tom,” besought the
badgered one.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>THE OLD GRADUATE</small></h2>


<p>“Say, did you think to bring any spoons,
Tom?”</p>

<p>“What about the condensed milk?”</p>

<p>“And say, Tom, this isn’t a good brand of
coffee!”</p>

<p>“What made you get all canned corn? Why
didn’t you include some beans, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Say, if I’ve got to eat coffee with my fingers
I’m going to quit right now!”</p>

<p>“Look here, Tom! Didn’t I say I wanted a
soft cot? You’ve given me one as hard as a
board. I won’t stand for it!”</p>

<p>You can easily imagine the scene. The boys
had arrived in camp, and were just unpacking.
The tents&mdash;sleeping and dining&mdash;had been erected
after much labor, and with the aid of Senor Mendez,
who courteously offered his services.</p>

<p>“And for the love of the seven wonders of the
world, Tom, what made you buy this brand of
canned chicken?” demanded Sid, who was opening
a case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom Parsons put down the blanket he was taking
out of a trunk. He strode to the middle of
the tent, put his hands on his hips, surveyed his
three chums, and began:</p>

<p>“Say, look here, you fellows! I’ve done most
of the work around this outfit. I saw to it that
the baggage didn’t go astray when you chaps were
trying to flirt with those pretty girls in the train!
I ordered all the eats, and most of the other stuff.
I got Mendez to give us a hand, though none of
you wanted me to. I’ve looked after everything
from A to Z and you fellows have been loafing.
And now you jump on me because I didn’t get
mock-turtle soup instead of mulligatawny. You
don’t like the kind of coffee, and I suppose you’ll
faint if you don’t have condensed milk.</p>

<p>“Say, don’t you want finger bowls? Will you
have paper napkins, or just the plain fringed
style? Do you want your shaving water hot every
morning, and what time shall I have the ‘bawth’
ready? Are your nails manicured? If not, I
guess I can find time to do that. Would you like
silk pajamas, or will linen do? And if there’s
anything more that you confounded dudes want in
this camp&mdash;just get it yourselves&mdash;I’m done!
DONE! Do you hear? I’m through!” and,
fairly shouting the words Tom stalked out of the
tent and went and sat down on a log near the edge
of Lake Tonoka.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The other three stared at each other in amazement.
The rebellion of their chum had come like
a thunderbolt out of a clear sky.</p>

<p>“Er&mdash;what did&mdash;what did we do?” faltered
Sid.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear the like?” came from Phil.</p>

<p>“He’s mad all right&mdash;clear through,” spoke
Frank. “I guess we have been rather piling it
on.”</p>

<p>“It’s the first time I ever knew Tom to act like
this,” said Phil, soberly.</p>

<p>“He has done a lot of work,” put in Sid.</p>

<p>“And we have been finding a deal of fault,”
added Frank.</p>

<p>“How can we square him?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“You go out and talk to him, Frank,” proposed
Sid.</p>

<p>“No, I’ve got a better scheme than that,” came
from the Big Californian. “Let’s finish slicking
up in here ourselves, go on and get grub ourselves,
and then invite him in. He’ll see we didn’t mean
all we said, then.”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” declared Phil.</p>

<p>“We’ll do it,” agreed Sid.</p>

<p>Thereupon, paying no more attention to the
justly sulking lad by the water’s edge, the three
chums shortly had the sleeping tent in some kind
of shape. An oil stove had been brought, and on
this some coffee was soon steaming away, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the appetizing odor of ham and eggs wafted itself
over the camp.</p>

<p>Through it all Tom never turned his head, nor
did his companions speak to him. He must have
heard what was going on, but he never acknowledged
it. With merry whistles his chums drove
away the suggestion of gloom.</p>

<p>“Grub’s ready!” came the announcement of
Frank, as he walked over toward Tom. “Wilt
your most gracious majesty deign to partake of
our humble fare?” and he dropped on one knee,
and offered to Tom, on a plate, a slice of bread.</p>

<p>For a moment the tall pitcher held out against
the envoy, and then a faint smile broke over his
face.</p>

<p>“If you fellows are done finding fault,” he said,
“I’ll come in and help. But I don’t like to do all
the work, and then have it rubbed in the way you
chaps did.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, we did lay it on a bit thick,” admitted
Frank, contritely.</p>

<p>“And I got a bit hot under the collar,” spoke
Tom, confessing in his turn.</p>

<p>“Come on and eat,” urged Frank. “The stuff
is getting cold. It isn’t such bad coffee after all.”</p>

<p>“I paid enough for it,” retorted Tom.</p>

<p>And thus the little cloud was blown away. Soon
all were eating merrily. The meal being finished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
they began to get the cots in shape, for it was
drawing on to afternoon.</p>

<p>The boys had two large tents, one for eating,
and the other for sleeping in, and lounging during
the day. A smaller one served as kitchen and
storeroom.</p>

<p>By evening they were in good shape, and accepted
an invitation to take supper at one of the
cottages, the owner of which with his wife and
daughters, had learned that the boys were friends
of the Tylers, who had not yet arrived.</p>

<p>“Well, now for a good snooze!” exclaimed
Tom, as they got back to their tent that night, having
spent a pleasant evening with the Prudens.</p>

<p>“Did you bring any mosquito netting?” asked
Phil. “If you didn’t I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Silence!” warned Frank. “A certain amount
of mosquito bites will do us good&mdash;put ginger into
us for the rowing game.”</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;all right!” cried Phil, quickly. “I
didn’t mean that,” and he looked quickly at Tom,
fearing a return of the morning outbreak.</p>

<p>“When are the girls coming?” asked Sid, as he
began to get ready to turn in.</p>

<p>“What do you care?” asked Tom, quickly.
“Didn’t I see you trying to hold the hand of that
youngest Miss Pruden under the table?”</p>

<p>“Oh, fie!” cried Frank.</p>

<p>“I was not!” cried Sid, indignantly. “She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
lent me her ring, and it was so small I couldn’t
easily get it off again. She was trying to help me.”</p>

<p>“Say, when you tell ’em, tell ’em good and
big!” laughed Tom. “‘When are the girls coming?’
Say, you’re a nice one, you are, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Tom ducked in time to avoid the shoe Sid threw
at him.</p>

<p>“Easy, fellows,” cautioned Phil. “There are
other people on the island besides us, and they may
want to go to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Then make him dry up!” demanded Sid.</p>

<p>“I’ll be good,” promised Tom. “But when
you hold hands don’t be afraid to admit it. I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The other shoe came in his direction with such
poor aim that the candle was knocked over, the
lanterns not yet being in service.</p>

<p>“Cheese it!” warned Frank. “You’ll have the
place on fire. Light a match, somebody.”</p>

<p>All began groping about in the dark tent.</p>

<p>“Oh, for the love of tripe!” suddenly exclaimed
Tom.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“I stuck my foot in the water bowl!” exclaimed
the lad. “It was on the floor. I’m as wet as a
duck.”</p>

<p>“Serves you right!” declared Sid vindictively.</p>

<p>“‘Be good, sweet lad, and let who will be clever,’”
misquoted Phil with a chuckle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>But finally order was restored, and our friends
fell into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s doing to-day?” asked Sid, after
breakfast.</p>

<p>“I vote we take a trip down to college, and see
if any of the fellows are there rowing,” proposed
Frank. “If we can’t scare up enough to make the
eight, we can take out one of the fours.”</p>

<p>“Second the motion,” came from Tom, and the
others agreed, too.</p>

<p>They rowed down leisurely, being a bit stiff, not
only from their unusual exertions in making camp,
but also because they were out of practice. But
finally Randall was reached, and, to their disappointment,
they found only one or two lads there,
practicing in the singles. They all declined to take
a try in the eight, as they were going in for the
sculling races. Anyhow, there would not have
been enough for an eight with a coxswain.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to take a four,” said Tom, with a
sigh. “Frank, you’ll have to steer, as you can do
it better than any of us.”</p>

<p>A four-oared shell, as I explained, and as doubtless
most of you know, is steered by a mechanical
arrangement, worked by the feet of one of the
rowers.</p>

<p>Soon the four chums were pulling down the river,
gaining in skill each moment, as the memory of
what Coach Lighton had said recurred to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>They rowed a good distance, and then drew up
at a private float and got out to stretch their legs.
As they were about to put off again, an elderly
man, with a pleasant face, approached and asked:</p>

<p>“From Boxer Hall?”</p>

<p>“From Randall,” replied Tom.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I noticed you rowing in. I think you
might improve your stroke a little if you would
feather differently. You don’t turn your hands
quite at the proper time.”</p>

<p>“You must be an old oarsman?” said Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve been in the game. I used to row at
Cornell years ago. Pierson is my name.”</p>

<p>“Are you <em>that</em> Pierson?” cried Frank, remembering
the name as that of one of the best scullers
Cornell ever turned out.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I am,” was the smiling answer.</p>

<p>“Say,” burst out Sid. “Would you mind watching
us a bit, and telling us our mistakes? We’re
new at it, as you probably noticed,” he went on,
“and Randall is just getting into the water sports.
We want to beat Boxer Hall. Can you give us a
few points?”</p>

<p>“Where are you staying?” asked Mr. Pierson.</p>

<p>“On Crest Island&mdash;we’re camping there.”</p>

<p>“So! Well, as it happens, I have friends there,
and I have been invited to spend part of the Summer
there. If I come I shall be glad to tell you
what I know of rowing, and coach you a bit. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
is the best sport in the world!” and Mr. Pierson’s
eyes sparkled as though he would like to get in the
shell himself.</p>

<p>“That will be fine!” exclaimed Tom. “We
shall look for you.”</p>

<p>They talked a little longer, the old oarsman
giving them some good advice about training.
Then he bade them good-bye, and walked off up
the hill leading from the river.</p>

<p>The boys got in the shell again, intending to
row to Randall, and then back to their camp.</p>

<p>As they neared the college float, and noted the
activity of the men building the new boathouse,
Sid exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Look who’s here!”</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>“Bossy, by all that’s tragic! He’s just taking
out a single shell. I wonder if he’s going to the
island?”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />
<small>THE GIRLS</small></h2>


<p>Rowing on up to the float, the four chums took
their shell out of the water just as Boswell got his
in. He looked over at them, and nodded in what
he evidently meant to be a friendly fashion, but
which he succeeded in making only patronizing.</p>

<p>“Out for a row?” he asked, needlessly.</p>

<p>“Just a bit of practice,” answered Sid.</p>

<p>“And you’re going in for the same thing, I
see,” added Phil.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve gone a bit stale since I was here last.
I just came back to-day, and I thought I’d take a
little row before I went up to our cottage on the
island.”</p>

<p>“He’s going there all right, then,” murmured
Tom.</p>

<p>“Are you fellows in camp yet?” asked Boswell.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Frank. “We haven’t got settled
yet, we’ll soon be in shape.” Then, with
an effort, he went on: “Drop in and see us&mdash;when
you get a chance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Phil administered an unseen but none the less
swift kick to his chum.</p>

<p>“What’d you want to go and do that for?”
he asked, in a whisper. It was safe since Boswell
was busy rattling the oars in his shell and could not
hear distinctly.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t do any less,” retorted Frank. “It
would look pretty raw not to ask him.”</p>

<p>“I hope he doesn’t accept,” murmured Sid, and,
the next moment the rich lad replied:</p>

<p>“Thanks, but I don’t expect to get much time
for calling. I’m going to be pretty busy with my
sculling, and I expect a friend or two up. Besides,
I never did like a tent. It always seems so musty
to me. I much prefer a cottage.”</p>

<p>“Thank the kind Fates for that!” murmured
Tom.</p>

<p>Boswell got in the shell, and rowed off, rather
awkwardly, the four thought, but then they had
yet to see themselves row, though, truth to tell,
they were becoming more expert every day.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have a professional oarsman coach
me,” Boswell threw to them over his shoulder as
he sculled off. “I expect to be in good trim, soon.
As long as you fellows didn’t want me in the eight,
I’m going to win in the singles, just to show you
what I can do.”</p>

<p>“We never said we didn’t want you in the
eight!” declared Frank. “In fact I thought you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
did as well at bow as anyone. It was the coach’s
doings.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Boswell. “It doesn’t
matter. I rather think I prefer this, on the whole.
And I’m going to win, too!” he boasted.</p>

<p>“Good! We hope you do!” exclaimed Tom.
Then, to his chums he added: “Come on, let’s
get back to the island and enjoy it before he starts
his monkey business there. I wonder when his
cottage opens?”</p>

<p>“I saw a woman and a man working around
there to-day, just before we left,” volunteered Sid.</p>

<p>“Then Bossy’s folks must be coming soon&mdash;more’s
the pity&mdash;I mean as far as he is concerned,”
put in Phil. “His folks may be decent enough, but
he’s the limit.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he and that English pal of his&mdash;Pierce&mdash;will
be drinking tea every afternoon at
five o’clock,” said Tom. “They’ll have their cakes
and Young Hyson out on the lawn, and&mdash;Oh,
‘slush, isn’t it fierce! A bally rotter, dontcherknow!’”</p>

<p>“The Knockers Club will please come to
order!” exclaimed Frank, in mock seriousness.</p>

<p>“Say, I guess we have been piling it on pretty
thick,” admitted Tom, with a grin. “Let’s get
in our old tub, and pull back. It’s my turn to rest
this trip.”</p>

<p>Laughing and joking, with occasional references<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to the proper way to handle an oar, and
some talk of the offer of Mr. Pierson to coach
them, the lads rowed back to their camp. They
spent the next two days in getting the place in
better shape.</p>

<p>“For exhibition purposes,” Sid explained. “The
girls might come to lunch some day.”</p>

<p>“Say, he’s got girls on the brain!” complained
Phil. “Duck him, Tom, you aren’t doing anything.”</p>

<p>But Sid discretely got out of the way.</p>

<p>A day later the Boswell family arrived at the
island. There were several servants&mdash;almost too
many for the simple cottage&mdash;and Mr. and Mrs.
Boswell, in addition to their son. It was hard to
see from whom the lad inherited his unpleasant
mannerisms, for both his parents were of the old-fashioned
school of gentlemen and ladies, with exceedingly
kind hearts. Boswell had evidently been
spoiled, unless he did the spoiling process himself,
which was more than likely.</p>

<p>When Mr. Boswell learned that some of his
son’s college mates were on the island, he paid a
formal call on them, and invited them to the cottage.
They promised to come&mdash;some time.</p>

<p>“When Bossy isn’t home, I hope,” murmured
Sid.</p>

<p>Pierce, Boswell’s English chum, arrived that
same week, and after that our friends saw little of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the rich lad. He and his friend were generally
off together in a boat rowing or fishing.</p>

<p>Then another personage made his appearance,
an athletic-looking man, whom Boswell introduced
as his “trainer.” Then began the instruction in
sculling. Tom and the others heard and saw some
of it.</p>

<p>“He’s teaching him a totally different stroke
than we row,” said Sid. “I wonder if it can be
right?”</p>

<p>“I’ll stick to Lighton’s method,” declared
Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes, for it’s the same as that used by Mr.
Pierson,” added Tom. “It’s good enough for
us.”</p>

<p>The Cornell oarsman had paid a visit or two
to the lads in their camp, coming from where he
was stopping on the mainland, as his friend,
whom he expected to visit on the island, had not
yet opened his cottage.</p>

<p>Mr. Pierson gave the boys some good advice,
and getting into the shell several times, practiced
what he preached. He had not forgotten his early
skill, and his illustrations were valuable.</p>

<p>“He can pull a good stroke yet,” declared
Frank, one day, following some spirited instruction
and practice. Mr. Pierson had left, promising
to devote more time to the boys later on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“He sure must have been a wonder in his day,”
declared Tom.</p>

<p>It was one morning just after the lads had finished
breakfast, and were getting their camp in
shape for the day, preparatory to going for a
row, that Tom made a momentous discovery.</p>

<p>He had been to the spring for a pail of water,
and, on his return he noticed on the porch of the
Tyler cottage a number of trunks and suitcases.
Then a flutter of dresses caught his eye, and he
heard a chorus of musical laughter.</p>

<p>“The girls have come!” cried Tom, and he
raced for his own camp, as he had on a pair of old
trousers and a disreputable sweater, and wanted
to get in more presentable shape for making them
welcome.</p>

<p>“The girls have come!” he cried, springing into
the midst of his chums with such force that he
spilled half the water. “The girls have come!”</p>

<small>AT PRACTICE</small></h2>


<p>“Did you see ’em?”</p>

<p>“Are they all there?”</p>

<p>“What about Helen Newton?”</p>

<p>“Say, where’s my brown suit?”</p>

<p>“Has anyone seen my purple tie?”</p>

<p>“Give me those shoes, Sid! Who said you could
take ’em, anyhow&mdash;my best ones?” and Phil fairly
upset his chum in order to rescue the footgear that
had been taken without his permission.</p>

<p>I presume the reader can understand the meaning
of the expressions which open this chapter.
They had to do directly with Tom’s startling announcement,
and who said which or what does not
matter. Sufficient to state that Sid, Phil and Frank
thus overwhelmed Tom with the above questions.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see any of ’em,” went on Tom, when
he could get his breath. “But I heard her
laugh&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Heard who laugh?” demanded Phil.</p>

<p>“Your sister.”</p>

<p>“I thought you said they <em>all</em> came!” reproached
Sid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“So I did, and so they have. Do you think one
girl would have four trunks and four suitcases?”
asked Tom, in indignant justification.</p>

<p>“They might&mdash;I have known of such,” said
Frank. “But are you sure they’re all here?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Didn’t I hear ’em all laugh? Anyhow,
Madge must be here, or Ruth wouldn’t be
at the cottage. And if two of ’em are there the
other two are, too.”</p>

<p>“That’s no reason at all,” said Phil, firmly.
“This will have to be investigated. Where’s my
clean shirt? I’m going to see my sister!” and he
strode into the tent.</p>

<p>“It’s the first time Phil was ever so thoughtful
of his sister, fellows. I guess we’d better all get
togged up a bit,” said Frank, and the activities,
that had begun when Tom came in with the news
(which activities had ceased momentarily while
the glad tidings were being confirmed), were again
resumed.</p>

<p>“Glad rags,” as the lads slangily designated
their habiliments, other than the ones in which they
worked about the camp, were soon being donned,
and a little later the boys were on their way to
the Tyler cottage.</p>

<p>“I wonder how long they’re going to stay?”
said Sid.</p>

<p>“As long as we do, I hope,” said Tom. “There
they are!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“All four of ’em, sure enough,” added Phil.</p>

<p>“You were a good guesser, Tom, old man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, leave it to your Uncle Dudley!” declared
Tom, puffing out his chest. “Little Willie knows
what he’s about.”</p>

<p>“Hello, boys!” called Madge Tyler, as she
caught sight of the advancing four.</p>

<p>“Welcome to our city,” added Ruth, as she
threw a kiss to&mdash;her brother. At least Tom said
so, when they accused him later of intercepting it,
and Tom ought to know.</p>

<p>“Glad you’re here.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t this place lovely?”</p>

<p>“Where is your boat?”</p>

<p>“Have you a motor?”</p>

<p>“Are you going to invite us to lunch in the
tent?”</p>

<p>These questions and comments were bandied
back and forth among the boys and girls, no one
caring very much who said what, so glad were they
to see each other, and exchange greetings and experiences.</p>

<p>“We girls just came up this morning,” explained
Madge. “We didn’t wait for mother, and father
has some tiresome business to look after so he
couldn’t come. But I just said that Jeanette, our
maid, was chaperone enough, and so we came. I
guess the man on the boat thought we had baggage
enough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“But he was nice about it,” added Ruth.</p>

<p>“Yes, after I gave him a quarter,” explained
Helen.</p>

<p>“Oh, you dear! Did you really tip him?”
asked Madge.</p>

<p>“Certainly&mdash;he&mdash;er&mdash;well, he seemed to expect
it,” and the boys laughed at her naive explanation.</p>

<p>“Won’t you come in?” invited Madge. “It
isn’t much of a cottage, and we can’t even offer
you a cup of tea, for we’re all out, and I had to
send Jeanette for some.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that,” remarked Phil.</p>

<p>“We’ve got all the food we can eat over at the
tent,” went on Tom.</p>

<p>All entered the charming little cottage, and the
boys told of their experiences since coming to
camp, while the girls detailed the happenings of
their journey that morning.</p>

<p>A small steamer, making regular trips about
the lake, had left them and their baggage at the
island, which was beginning to be quite a Summer
resort. A new store had recently been built on the
place, and provided a variety of articles, including
foodstuffs for the cottagers.</p>

<p>“There’s a boat or two with this cottage,” explained
Madge. “We’ll have to get them in the
water to soak up, I suppose, and then we girls will
give you boys some lessons in rowing; won’t we,
girls?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“We might try,” said Ruth, drily.</p>

<p>“Your boats are in the water, I think,” said
Sid. “I saw that Mexican ‘take-care’ man, as he
calls himself, at them the other day, caulking up
some cracks.”</p>

<p>“That’s good,” retorted Madge. “I know
father wrote on to have this done, but I’ve been so
busy, getting ready to come here, that I forgot to
ask if it had been attended to. I wish we had a
motor-launch, but father is so old-fashioned, if I
must say it, that he won’t hear of it.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you boys a launch?” asked Helen.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Tom, “but perhaps we can hire
one,” and he looked at Ruth, who had been trying
to signal him when the Mexican’s name was
mentioned.</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” declared Phil. “We’ll
see about it this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Then Jeanette, the maid, having come from the
store with the tea, the boys took their leave, to
allow the girls time to change into more comfortable
and camp-like garments, and also to enjoy their
beverage.</p>

<p>“We’ll see you after lunch,” called Phil.</p>

<p>“We’d ask you to stay,” spoke Madge, “but
really we haven’t quite found ourselves yet. Later
on&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Come on over to our tent,” invited Sid.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” laughed the young hostess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
“Some other time. We have to unpack our
dresses, or they’ll get wrinkled.”</p>

<p>The boys thought lunch time would never pass,
but it did, though they made a hasty meal of it.
Then they hurried back to the cottage, and a little
later four pairs of young persons were strolling
in four different directions over the beautiful
island.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom!” exclaimed Ruth. “I’ve been just
wild to get you alone for a moment to ask if you’ve
found out anything about my brooch?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing, Ruth, I’m sorry to say. In fact
the whole business is at a standstill. We had
some suspicions, but they didn’t lead anywhere,
and we’re up against a stone wall so far in the
game.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps something may develop,” she
said with a sigh. “I hope so, for I’m afraid every
day some of my folks will discover that I’m not
wearing the brooch. When I went to bid grandmother
good-bye I wore a large bow tie, so she
couldn’t see the place where the pin ought to have
been, but wasn’t. Isn’t it dreadful to be so deceitful?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” Tom hastened to assure her. “It
isn’t your fault, and, as you say, something may
develop.”</p>

<p>They strolled on, as did the others, and the
afternoon seemed wonderfully short.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>I note, in looking back over some pages I have
written, that I headed this chapter “At Practice,”
and really I meant to devote considerable space to
detailing the doings of Tom and his chums in the
shell, under the guidance of Mr. Pierson. But I
find that the girls have taken up such a large proportion
of my available space that I have not much
left for rowing matters. And, in fact, the boys
found themselves in the same predicament. After
all, I suppose, it is not an unforgivable crime.</p>

<p>Tom and his chums kept promising themselves,
from day to day, after the arrival of the girls, that
they would buckle down to hard work in the shell,
but each day saw them over at the cottage as early
as decency and good manners would allow, and the
same thing kept them there as late as possible.</p>

<p>They hired a small gasoline launch, that was
continually getting out of order, and stopping out
in the middle of the lake. They had to be towed
in so frequently that they became very well known.
But it was all the more fun.</p>

<p>“There’s something about this launch that you
don’t often find,” remarked Frank, one day when
they had been drifting helplessly about.</p>

<p>“And it’s a good thing you don’t,” added Tom.</p>

<p>“What I meant,” said Frank, “was that it
never gets monotonous. The same thing never
happens twice.”</p>

<p>“I should say not,” declared Sid. “Everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
on the old tub has broken one time or another,
from the old cups to the piston rings, and
everything from the spark coil to the batteries has
given out! Monotonous? I should say nixy!”</p>

<p>Yet the boys did practice. Frank grew desperate
when a week had gone by without their getting
into the shell, and he spoke to such advantage,
dwelling on the necessity of keeping in condition,
that the others agreed with him. So they left the
girls to their own devices one morning, and rowed
down to college.</p>

<p>They found quite a number of their chums there,
and considerable practice was going on. Mr.
Lighton had paid one of his flying visits and was
giving the lads some instruction.</p>

<p>Our friends told him of Mr. Pierson’s offer, and
the coach said:</p>

<p>“You could not do better, boys, than to follow
his advice. I wish we could get him to come to
Randall in the Fall.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he will,” suggested Sid. “We’ll ask
him.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lighton said he had word from Bricktop
Molloy, and one or two of the others, that they
were getting in some practice during the Summer
vacation.</p>

<p>“I hope we have a good eight when college
opens again,” he concluded, as Tom and his chums
rowed off in the four-oared shell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Pierson was staying on the island now, and
for the next few days he was with the boys considerably,
giving them valuable advice. They kept
at practice, setting aside certain hours for it, and
manfully withstanding the temptation of going off
on little excursions with the girls.</p>

<p>So far as solving the mystery of the missing
jewelry was concerned, no progress was made,
though the boys talked about it often. The faint
suspicions against the Mexican and Boswell were
still maintained, but that was all.</p>

<p>As for Boswell, he and his English friend and
his “trainer,” as he called the athlete, kept pretty
much to themselves. Mendez was the same over-polite
Mexican as before. He opened his store,
and did a good business, our friends patronizing
him to some extent&mdash;partly to get a look inside
his place. But, though their eyes were used to the
best advantage, they saw nothing that would aid
them in their quest.</p>

<p>“But I’ll get Ruth’s brooch back yet!” declared
Tom, to himself.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>“SENOR BOSWELL”</small></h2>


<p>“Shoulders back a little more! Heads up!
Don’t feather quite so high. That’s all right to
do when there are little choppy waves, that would
cause splashing, but in calm water the lower you
feather the less you have to raise the spoon of
the oar. Of course don’t do any ‘riffling.’ That
holds back the boat. When I see you in an eight,
with a coxswain, so you don’t have to think about
steering, I can tell better how you will do.”</p>

<p>This was Mr. Pierson giving some coaching advice
to the four boys, who were out in the shell.
He was following them in the launch owned by
his friend, at whose cottage he was visiting.</p>

<p>“I’m wondering if I’ll have wind enough for a
four-mile race, pulling even thirty to the minute?”
said Sid.</p>

<p>“And we may have to hit it up to thirty-two or
three,” put in Tom.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about those things now,” advised
the Cornell graduate. “They will work themselves
out when you get in training. Of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
you’re not training now, and that makes a difference.
My chief anxiety at present is to get you
in the way of taking the proper stroke, to teach
you how to sit, how to slide in the moving seats,
how to bring your whole weight where it will do
the most good, and how to depend on the toe
stretchers. Your wind will take care of itself
when you get down to hard practice. If it doesn’t&mdash;well,
you can’t row in an eight, that’s all.”</p>

<p>The old graduate glanced sharply at the lads,
and, noting a look of anxiety on their faces, he
hastened to add:</p>

<p>“But I’m sure it will come out all right. Don’t
think about it. Now then, hit up the stroke a
little.”</p>

<p>And so he accompanied them over the course,
giving them advice almost invaluable, which they
could have obtained in no other way. The boys
appreciated it deeply.</p>

<p>Camp and cottage life on Crest Island was endless
delight to the boys, even with the hard practice
they put in occasionally. I say “occasionally”
advisedly, for they did not forget, nor did Mr.
Lighton or Mr. Pierson want them to forget, that
they were on their vacations. Truth to tell, the
girls took much of the time of our heroes. And
this was as it should be. We can never be young
but once, if I may be pardoned that bit of philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
in a story book&mdash;a bit that is not original by
any means.</p>

<p>“Well, thank our lucky stars, we don’t have to
grind away in the boat to-day!” exclaimed Sid one
morning, as he got up ahead of the others, for it
was his turn to prepare breakfast.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” called Tom, in a sleepy voice
from his cot, as he turned over luxuriously amid
the scanty coverings, for the night had been warm.
“I vote we get the launch in running order, if
that’s possible, and take the girls off for a picnic.”</p>

<p>“Second the motion,” exclaimed Sid, “with the
amendment that the girls provide, and put up, the
lunch.”</p>

<p>“We’ll pay for it, if they put it up,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“That’s better,” remarked Phil. “I’ll tip Sis
off, and I guess they’ll do it.”</p>

<p>Behold then, a little later, the eight young persons,
lively and gay, in the wheezy and uncertain
launch, voyaging over the lake toward a distant
dell of which they knew, on the mainland, where
they proposed to picnic for the day.</p>

<p>They ate the lunch which the girls had put up in
dainty fashion, sitting on a broad, flat rock near
the edge of the lake, with the wind rustling in the
trees overhead, and the birds flitting here and
there.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it glorious here?” mused Sid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>“Gorgeous!” declared Madge. “It’s just a
perfect day.”</p>

<p>“‘O, perfect day!’” began Phil.</p>

<p>“Cut out the poetry,” interrupted Tom.
“There’s a little snake crawling toward you, old
man.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” screamed four shrill voices, and there
was a hasty scramble, until the snake was discovered
to be only a tiny lizard, which the girls declared
to be “just as bad.”</p>

<p>Then came saunterings two-by-two off in woodland
glades until it was time to think regretfully of
returning to the island, for the shadows were
lengthening.</p>

<p>It was just as they were about to start off in the
little gasoline launch, which, strange to say, had
been behaving wonderfully well that day, that they
saw Mendez, the Mexican, rowing toward them
in a small boat. He seemed in much of a hurry.</p>

<p>“Senors and senoritas!” he hailed them. “Wait
a moment, I pray of you.”</p>

<p>“Gracious&mdash;I hope nothing has happened at
home!” exclaimed Madge Tyler, for her mother
was not at the cottage.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it’s a telegram for some of us,” suggested
Ruth. “Oh, dear, I do hope I don’t have
to go home.”</p>

<p>They all regarded the approaching Mexican
curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pardon,” he began with a smile that showed
all his white teeth, “but I seek Senor Boswell. Is
he with you?”</p>

<p>“With us? No,” answered Tom. “He doesn’t
train in with our crowd.”</p>

<p>“Most likely he’s having tea on the lawn, and
talking about ‘beastly rotters,’” suggested Sid.</p>

<p>“Oh, Sid!” exclaimed Ruth. “He isn’t such
a bad sort.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do you know him?” asked Tom, quickly.</p>

<p>“He called one evening,” explained Madge,
while just the faintest suggestion of a blush suffused
her pretty face. “He and Mr. Pierce.”</p>

<p>“They did!” exclaimed Phil, looking keenly at
his sister.</p>

<p>“Hush!” she exclaimed. “Silly boy. Don’t
make a scene!”</p>

<p>“Senor Boswell&mdash;is he not here?” went on the
Mexican, and there was anxiety in his voice. “I
was inform that he come off on a boat, and in this
direction. I see your launch moored here, and I
am of the belief, perhaps, that he may be here. Is
it not?” and again he smiled.</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t here, and we haven’t seen him,”
said Tom.</p>

<p>“Pardon, senors and senoritas,” said the Mexican,
bowing as well as he could in his small boat.
“I shall look farther. I have the honor to bid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
you good afternoon,” and he rowed away, up the
lake.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose he wanted of Boswell
in such a hurry?” asked Sid in a low voice of Tom,
as they were getting in the launch.</p>

<p>“Give it up,” was the answer, but Tom was
doing some hard thinking just about that time.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />
<small>JEALOUSY</small></h2>


<p>“We’ve got to do some pulling to-morrow,”
remarked Frank, as they rowed toward the island.
“Mr. Pierson said he’d show us a new wrinkle or
two.”</p>

<p>“And we want to begin to hit up the speed a
bit,” added Tom.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Phil, who was fussing
with the motor, that missed every now and then.</p>

<p>“But say!” exclaimed Sid. “I thought we
were going to take the girls down to watch some
of the other fellows row opposite college to-morrow?”
and there was a rueful look on his face.</p>

<p>“Well, I know we did speak of that,” said Tom,
“but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The implied invitation is declined with
thanks,” broke in Ruth. “We girls simply have
to do some house-cleaning to-morrow. The cottage
is a perfect sight, and it’s sweet of Madge not to
have found fault before.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s nothing of the sort!” declared the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
young and pretty hostess. “Don’t decline on that
account.”</p>

<p>“No, don’t!” besought Sid.</p>

<p>“But we really must stay home,” declared Mabel.
“I know we have upset things terribly, and
tossed our belongings about until I’m sure that
poor maid must be distracted picking things up.
Besides, Mr. Tyler is coming up to-morrow and I
know your mother will want the place in some sort
of decent shape, Madge. We must stay and help.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, yes,” echoed Helen Newton.</p>

<p>“Too bad!” declared Phil.</p>

<p>“Besides, it’s all you boys’ fault that it is so
upset,” went on Ruth.</p>

<p>“How do you make that out?” demanded Tom.</p>

<p>“Why you’re always coming along, begging us
to go out with you, and you’re always in such a
hurry that we can’t wait to pick up things. So
there!”</p>

<p>“Any reason, even if it’s a poor one,” remarked
Frank, drily.</p>

<p>They glided along for some time, and then the
motor suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>“Now what’s wrong?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“I knew something would happen if Phil didn’t
stop monkeying with it,” declared Tom.</p>

<p>“Monkey yourself!” retorted the lad who had
been acting as engineer. “All I did was to screw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the spark plug in a bit tighter, and shut the pet-cock.”</p>

<p>“Then you probably cracked the porcelain on
the spark plug, and there’s a short circuit,” spoke
Frank. “Here, let me take a look, and see what
the trouble is,” and as Frank had been successful
in times past, when the others had failed, they
made room for him at the motor.</p>

<p>He looked it over a moment, and then, seeing
that the switch was on, gave the flywheel a couple
of turns. There was only an apologetic wheeze.</p>

<p>“He knows so much about motors,” sarcastically
murmured Tom to Ruth.</p>

<p>“He knows enough to turn on the gasoline, at
any rate, and not try to run the motor with what’s
in the carburetor,” snapped back Frank, as he
opened the cock in the pipe leading from the tank
in the bow. “Who started this motor, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I did,” confessed Tom, the tables thus being
turned against him.</p>

<p>“Next time turn on the gas,” repeated Frank.
“It’s one of the first things to do in running a
motor-boat, sonny. You may write the word gasoline
twenty-five times before you go to sleep to-night,”
and all joined in the laugh against poor
Tom.</p>

<p>“Huh! I supposed it was always kept turned
on,” he said in defense.</p>

<p>“The carburetor leaks a little, so I always shut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the gas off at the tank,” explained Sid. “I guess
I forgot to mention it.”</p>

<p>“And I can easily guess why,” spoke Frank,
with a significant glance at the pretty girl beside
whom his chum was sitting.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s another little wrinkle&mdash;one of a
number&mdash;we’ve learned about the boat,” spoke
Tom, when they were once more under way.</p>

<p>“All good things have to come to and end, I suppose,”
remarked Sid, when they had landed and
were bidding the girls good-bye. “But we hope
there’ll be more excursions.”</p>

<p>“You can always ask us&mdash;at least as long as
we’re here,” said Mabel. “Though I’m afraid
we’ll have to go next week. It’s been perfectly
lovely of Madge to keep us this long&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Indeed you’re not going so soon!” declared
the hostess. “Why, you haven’t been here any
time at all yet, and when you do go I’ll be so lonesome&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“So will we!” chorused the lads. “Don’t go,”
and the girls laughingly promised to stay as long
as possible.</p>

<p>True to their determination, the lads went out
in the four-oared shell the next day, with Mr.
Pierson in the launch to coach them. He put them
through some stiff practice, and increased the
stroke to a number where the boys were almost on
the point of protesting. But they realized that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
they needed it, though they were glad to stop when
the word was given.</p>

<p>“A few days of that will put you in the way of
bettering your wind,” said the old college graduate,
with a whimsical smile. I have spoken of him
as an “old” graduate, but, in point of fact he
was not at all an elderly man. I merely used “old”
in a comparative sense.</p>

<p>“I wonder what’s the matter with Boswell?”
ventured Sid, as they rowed the shell back to the
college float, and prepared to motor back in the
launch. “I haven’t seen him out practicing to-day.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Tom. “And say, did
it strike any of you as queer the way that Mexican
was looking for him?”</p>

<p>“Somewhat,” admitted Frank.</p>

<p>“There must be something between them,” went
on Tom. “I wonder if, after all, it can have anything
to do with the missing jewelry?”</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I do, very definitely. But
that Mendez was certainly anxious to find Bossy,
though for what reason I can’t even guess.
Wouldn’t it be queer if Bossy had found those
cups and other things, and gotten rid of ’em
through the Mexican, after he found he had carried
the joke too far?”</p>

<p>“I believe you,” replied Frank. “But it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
pretty far-fetched to my way of thinking. I’d hate
to believe that any Randall man would be guilty
of such a thing.”</p>

<p>“So would I,” added Phil.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I only mentioned it as a supposition,”
said Tom, in self-defense. “Anyhow, Bossy
sure does practice hard in his single. I guess that
trainer of his knows his business.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s a good trainer,” admitted Frank.
“I’ve heard of him, but it’s pretty near the limit
for a fellow to have a private trainer. It’s too
much like putting on lugs.”</p>

<p>“It is that,” said Phil. “And I suppose, when
we get back in the Fall, about all we’ll hear will
be Bossy and his shell.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if he has a chance to win?” asked
Tom. “They have some expert scullers at Boxer
Hall.”</p>

<p>“Well, they ought to have; look how long
they’ve been at it,” retorted Frank.</p>

<p>“I’ll be rather glad to get back to college
again,” went on the tall pitcher. “This loafing
life is good, but I’m anxious to get in the eight.”</p>

<p>“So am I,” came from Sid, “but it’s sport here,”
and he looked toward the island they were approaching,
probably thinking of the girls. So far
the four chums had not been able to get five others,
one the coxswain, with them so that they could row
in the eight-oared shell. But the four gave them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
sufficient practice, Mr. Pierson thought, since,
after all, it was a matter of the stroke, and could
be acquired in one craft as well as in another.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a little scene was taking place near
the Tyler cottage, that, had our friends beheld it&mdash;or,
rather one of our friends in particular&mdash;might
have caused some trouble.</p>

<p>The girls were kept busy with some light housework,
helping Mrs. Tyler and the maid, after the
boys left. Then, having put their rooms in order
they attired themselves in fresh gowns and walked
off toward the water. Near the cottage Boswell
occupied, the four young ladies met the rich lad
and his English chum. The two were out for a
walk, and, as the youths stopped to chat for a
moment with Madge, whom they had met formally,
she could do no less than halt a moment with
the other girls, who had been introduced to the
lads.</p>

<p>“Come down and I’ll take you out in my
launch,” invited Boswell. “I’ve just got a new
one, and it’s quite fast.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on!” cried Ruth, impulsively.
“That one Phil and the boys have is so slow, and
something is always happening to it.”</p>

<p>“My word! I should say so!” laughed Pierce.</p>

<p>“But we declined an invitation to go out with&mdash;our
boys,” said Mabel Harrison, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” spoke Ruth. “They had to go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
practice anyhow, and we won’t be long. Come
on.”</p>

<p>It was a delightful day, and the invitation was
hard to resist. Behold then, as a Frenchman
would say, behold then, a little later, the four
pretty girls in Boswell’s launch, with himself and
Pierce making themselves as agreeable as they
knew how. And to give them their due, they knew
how to interest girls, and were deferential and
polite in their demeanor.</p>

<p>“Your pin is coming unfastened,” remarked
Boswell to Ruth, as they were speeding along, and
he motioned to a bit of lace at her throat&mdash;lace
caught up with a simple gold bar clasp.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you,” she answered, as she fastened
it, and then she blushed, and was angry at herself
for doing it.</p>

<p>“Where is that lovely old-fashioned brooch you
used to wear?” asked Madge, looking at her
chum.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;er&mdash;I wouldn’t wear it out in a boat, anyhow,”
said Ruth, blushing redder than before.
“I&mdash;I might lose it. See, wasn’t that a fish that
jumped over there!” and she pointed to the left,
glad of a chance to change the subject.</p>

<p>“Yes, and a jolly big fellow, too!” declared
Pierce. “Why can’t we get up a fishing party,
and take you girls?” he asked. “My word, it
would be jolly sport! We could take our lunch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and have tea in the woods, a regular outing, dontcherknow.”</p>

<p>“That’s the ticket!” exclaimed Boswell. “Will
you girls come?” and he looked particularly at
Ruth.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she replied and then, in the
spirit of mischief, she added: “I’ll ask my
brother. Perhaps he’d like to come. He is a
good fisherman.”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;er&mdash;it wasn’t so much about the fish that
I was thinking,” spoke Pierce, a bit dismayed, and
then he dropped the subject.</p>

<p>“Are you fond of old-fashioned jewelry?”
asked Boswell, in a low voice to Ruth. “I mean
old brooches and the like?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;why?” asked Ruth rather startled.</p>

<p>“Oh, I only just wanted to know. I’m a bit
that way myself. My mother has a very old
brooch that I gave her. I mean it was old when
I came across it and bought it. I’ll borrow it
some day and let you see it.”</p>

<p>Ruth murmured a polite rejoinder, scarcely
knowing what she did say, and then, as one of the
lake steamers approached rather dangerously close
to the launch, there was a moment of excitement
aboard both craft, for Pierce, who should have
been steering, had neglected it for the agreeable
task of being polite to Mabel Harrison.</p>

<p>But nothing more than a scare resulted. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
matters had quieted down, the talk turned into
another channel, and Ruth was glad to keep it
there.</p>

<p>The topic of the brooch, she thought, was a
rather dangerous one for her, since she wanted to
keep from her friends, and especially from Tom
and her folks, the knowledge of the missing pin.
She was hoping against hope that it would be
found. She wondered what Boswell meant by his
reference, but did not dare ask him.</p>

<p>The ride was a pleasant one, though the girls&mdash;all
of them&mdash;felt that they had, perhaps, been just
a bit mean toward their boy chums. Still, as
Madge had said, Tom and his friends did have
practice.</p>

<p>“We better go back now,” said Ruth, after a
bit. “It has been delightful, though.”</p>

<p>“And the engine didn’t break down once,”
added Helen.</p>

<p>“Oh I don’t get things that break,” spoke Boswell,
with an air of pride. “But you don’t want
to go in so soon; do you?”</p>

<p>“We must,” insisted Madge, and, rather
against their wishes, the boys turned back.</p>

<p>As Fate would have it, the new launch got to
the Boswell dock just as the craft containing Tom
and his chums hove in sight. Their wheezy boat
puffed slowly along, and as it was steered in
toward the dock they had improvised near their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
tent, the boys saw Boswell and his chum helping
the girls out. Then Boswell walked alongside
Ruth, seeming to be in earnest conversation with
her.</p>

<p>“Say, would you look at that!” cried Sid.
“The girls were out with those chaps!”</p>

<p>“And after refusing to come with us!” went
on Frank.</p>

<p>“I like their nerve!” declared Phil.</p>

<p>Tom said nothing, but there came a queer look
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we’re not the only fellows on
the island,” spoke Frank, philosophically. “We
couldn’t expect them to stay in, waiting for us to
come back, on such a fine day as this.”</p>

<p>“But they said they were going to be busy,” objected
Sid.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I guess what they had to do could
be dropped and picked up again, when there was a
launch ride in the offing,” went on the Big Californian.
“We’ll call around after supper and
take ’em out. There’s going to be a glorious
moon.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” cried Sid. But when evening came,
and the others attired themselves more or less
gaily, ready for a call, Tom did not doff his old
garments.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, sport; aren’t you coming?”
asked Sid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nope.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Ruth won’t want to go unless you’re
there.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I’m not going. I don’t feel
like it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on.”</p>

<p>“Nope.”</p>

<p>“What shall I tell her?” asked Sid, looking to
see that Phil and Frank had gone on ahead.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” and Tom began filling a lantern,
this being one of his duties that week.</p>

<p>Sid stood regarding his chum for a moment, and
then without a word, but with a suggestive shrug
of his shoulders, went out.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>A STRANGE CONFERENCE</small></h2>


<p>“You missed it, old man; we had a dandy
time,” remarked Frank, when he, together with
Sid and Phil, drifted into the sleeping tent some
time later.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Tom,” added Sid. “The cake
was good.”</p>

<p>“And the lemonade, too,” added Phil.</p>

<p>“Um!” sleepily grunted Tom. Or was he only
simulating sleep?</p>

<p>“And the girls were jolly,” went on Frank.</p>

<p>“And Ruth wanted to know why you hadn’t
come,” proceeded Sid, keeping up the chorus of
description.</p>

<p>“Oh, let me go to sleep,” growled Tom.</p>

<p>“Bossy and his chum blew in, but they didn’t
stay long,” added Phil. “I guess they didn’t expect
to find us there.”</p>

<p>“Was Boswell there?” demanded Tom, sitting
up on his cot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure,” retorted Sid, at the same time giving
Frank a nudge in the ribs as much as to say:
“There’s where the shoe pinches.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a headache,” said Tom, only half
truthfully. “I guess that row in the hot sun was
a little too much for me to-day.”</p>

<p>“Can we do anything for you?” asked Frank,
trying to make his voice sound anxious.</p>

<p>“No, I’ll sleep it off,” and turning with his face
toward the tent wall, Tom proceeded to slumber&mdash;or
pretend to.</p>

<p>It was two days after this when Tom and Ruth
met. He had studiously avoided calling at the
Tyler cottage, though the other boys went over
each evening. Tom gave some excuse, and each
time Sid and the others came in at night they
would remark about the good time they had had.</p>

<p>“You’re missing it,” declared Phil, winking at
his chums. “Boswell is filling in your place fine.”</p>

<p>“Was he there again?” snapped Tom.</p>

<p>“Sure thing. He and Sis seem to get on well
together, though I don’t care for the chap. Still
he isn’t such a bad sort as I thought at first.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Boswell had not called since
that first evening, but Phil guessed Tom’s secret,
and wickedly and feloniously egged it on.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Tom; why haven’t you
called?” asked Ruth with perfect sincerity when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
she and the tall pitcher did meet, following some
busy days devoted for the most part by the boys
to rowing practice. “I wanted to ask you about
something?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;er&mdash;I’ve been busy,” he said, trying to
make himself believe that. Ruth didn’t. “Besides,”
he blurted out, with a school-boy mannerism
that he hated himself for disclosing, “I
thought Mr. Boswell could keep you interested.”</p>

<p>“Tom Parsons!” and Ruth’s eyes flashed dangerously.</p>

<p>“He seems to be quite a steady caller,” he
stumbled on, growing more and more confused
and uncomfortable. He felt more childish than
ever, and I am not saying he was not. “I didn’t
know whether there’d be room for me and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Tom, I don’t think that’s fair of you,” and
Ruth was plainly hurt. “Mr. Boswell has only
been over one evening, when the other boys were
there, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Only once?” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“That’s all. The same evening of the day
when we were out in his launch. I couldn’t help
talking to him then, and if you think&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I don’t think anything!” broke in Tom.
“I’ve been a chump. They said he’d been over
there every night. Oh, wait until I get hold of
your brother!”</p>

<p>“Did Phil say that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“He did.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll settle with him, too. But, Tom, I
wanted to ask if you thought there was any chance
of finding my brooch?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Ruth. It begins to look rather
hopeless.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought, and, as long as I’m
not going to get it back I may as well admit that
it is gone. I can’t go on deceiving people this way,
even in so small a matter. I suppose it was careless
of me to let the clasp get broken in the first
place. I put it on in a hurry one day, and strained
it. And in the second place, I suppose I ought to
have given it to a more reliable jeweler.</p>

<p>“But that Mr. Farson called at the college one
day soliciting repair work to do. He said he had
some from Boxer Hall, so I thought he was all
right, and let him take my pin. I’m sorry now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is too bad,” assented Tom, “but it
can’t be helped. I don’t really believe, Ruth, that
there’s any use looking on this island for the pin.
I have been keeping my eyes open for it, but I’m
beginning to think that it’s like hunting for the
proverbial thimble in the straw pile.”</p>

<p>“You mean needle in the haystack.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s the same thing. I never can get
those proverbs straight. The only hope is that
we might, some day, discover who took the things,
and your brooch might be recovered. But it’s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
pretty slim chance, now that all our clues seemed
to have failed.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought. So I guess I’ll confess
and brave grandmother’s wrath. But, oh!
I know she’ll never leave me her lovely pearls!”</p>

<p>“Maybe someone else will,” suggested Tom.
“Will you come down to the store and have some
soda water? He’s got in a fresh lot, I believe.”</p>

<p>“I will, Tom, for I’m thirsty enough to drink
even the lemon-pop Mr. Richards sells. Come
on,” and the two walked on, the little cloud that
had come between them having blown away. But
Ruth said nothing about Boswell’s promise to
show her his mother’s old-fashioned brooch. Perhaps
she thought he had forgotten the matter, and,
she reasoned, there was no need of awakening
Tom’s jealousy.</p>

<p>It was after Tom had parted from Ruth, with
a promise to call that evening with the other boys,
that, walking along the island shore, taking a short
cut to the camp, he heard voices coming from the
direction of the water. He looked through the
screen of bushes, and saw Boswell and the Mexican
caretaker, sitting in a boat not far from shore.
The college lad was handing Mendez something,
and by the sun’s rays Tom caught the glitter of
gold. At the same time a puff of wind brought
their voices plainly to him, the water aiding in
carrying the tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you think you could get an old-fashioned
pin like that?” Boswell was asking. “You know
something about jewelry; don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of a surety, senor. But this would be hard
to duplicate. It is very old.”</p>

<p>“I know, but I want one like that, or as near
it as possible. Can’t you get one the same place
you got that?”</p>

<p>“No, senor, that was the only one there was,
and when I sell him to you for your respected
mother I regret that I can get no more of him.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get that?” asked Boswell, as
he took back from the Mexican what Tom could
now see was some sort of breastpin.</p>

<p>“Why do you ask, senor?” retorted the man,
quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing special. Why, you act as though
you thought that I was going to accuse you of
stealing it.”</p>

<p>“Never, senor!” exclaimed the man quickly.
“I get this from a friend, and I sell it to you for
very little more than I paid.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was cheap enough,” went on the lad.
“I’m not kicking. Only I’d like to get another.
I knew mother would like this, and she did. She
loves old-fashioned things.”</p>

<p>“And you want another for one who also loves
of the time that is past&mdash;is that it, senor?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ve guessed it, Mendez. But keep mum
about it. I want to surprise her.”</p>

<p>Then the wind, blowing in a contrary direction,
carried the voices away, and Tom kept on, having
only halted momentarily.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>IN THE SHACK</small></h2>


<p>“Jove!” murmured Tom, as he hurried on,
“what have I stumbled upon?”</p>

<p>For the time being his thoughts were in a whirl,
for like a flash it had come to him that the pin he
had seen being handled by Mendez and Boswell
was Ruth’s missing brooch.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t get close enough for a good look,
but it sure was an old-fashioned pin, from their
talk, and it looked like the one I’ve seen Ruth
wear. The one with the secret spring.”</p>

<p>He walked on a little farther.</p>

<p>“Now what’s to be done?” he asked himself.
“I guess I’ll sit down and think this thing out.”</p>

<p>Rapidly Tom went over in his mind what he
had seen and heard.</p>

<p>“This seems to let Boswell out of it,” he murmured.
“And I’m glad of it&mdash;for the honor of
Randall,” and Tom thought of the events that
had taken place some time ago, when the honor of
Randall seemed to be threatened, events which
I have narrated in the book of that title.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“If Boswell bought the pin of Mendez, then it
must be the Mexican who is the man we’re after,”
Tom went on. “He deals in jewelry, though most
of it is that filigree silver stuff that I don’t fancy.
And Boswell wants Mendez to get him another
old-fashioned pin like the one he already has. I
wonder who for?”</p>

<p>But Tom did not wonder long on this point.</p>

<p>“The insolent puppy!” he exclaimed, clenching
his fists. “If he tries to give Ruth a pin
I’ll&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>And then he calmed down, for he realized that,
aside from the ethics, or good taste of the matter,
Boswell had as much right to present Ruth with
a token as had he himself.</p>

<p>“I guess I’d better reason along a new line,”
he told himself. “I’ll have to let the boys know
about this, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Then, like a flash something else occurred to
him.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t do that,” he said. “Phil isn’t
supposed to know that Ruth has lost her pin&mdash;that
is, not yet. It would be too bad if the grandmother
were to turn cranky, because of the loss
of the brooch, and give her pearls to someone
else&mdash;at least until I can buy Ruth some pearls
myself&mdash;and that’s a long way off, I’m afraid,”
thought Tom, ruefully.</p>

<p>“No, I’ve got to play this hand alone,” he went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
on. “I can’t bring the fellows in&mdash;just yet. And
I must tell Ruth not to admit that she has lost her
brooch&mdash;at least, not yet. I may be able to get it
back for her. The idea of Boswell having it&mdash;at
least, I think it’s the same one.</p>

<p>“And then by Jove! If Mendez had the brooch
he has the other stuff that was in the jewelry box&mdash;the
Boxer Hall cups and so on. Tom Parsons,
you’ve stumbled on the solution of the mystery, I
do believe. And you’ve got to work it out alone,
for if you tell any of the fellows Ruth’s secret
will come out. Now, how are you going to do it?”</p>

<p>He pondered on the matter, and the first thing
he decided on was that Ruth must be warned not
to admit her loss.</p>

<p>“I’ll attend to that right away,” murmured the
lad.</p>

<p>“Why, Tom, is anything the matter?” asked
Ruth, when he saw her, a little later, at the Tyler
cottage.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, something, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, is Phil hurt?” and she clasped her hands.</p>

<p>“No, nothing like that. What made you think
something was up, Ruth?”</p>

<p>“Because your face told me. What is it?”</p>

<p>“Well, if I were you, I wouldn’t tell&mdash;just yet&mdash;that
you haven’t your brooch.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom! Do you mean you think you can
get it back?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think so, but I’m not sure. But don’t say
anything.”</p>

<p>“I won’t. Oh! I’m only too glad not to have
to admit it, though I’m afraid it’s only postponing
the fatal day. But what have you found?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you Ruth&mdash;just yet. I’ve got quite
a problem to work out. Later on I may need your
help.”</p>

<p>“Why, can’t some of the boys?&mdash;oh, I see,
you’re keeping my secret for me. That’s fine of
you!”</p>

<p>“Just wait&mdash;that’s all,” was Tom’s final advice.
In the exuberance of his youth he imagined, that,
should it prove that Boswell had bought Ruth’s
pin from the Mexican, the brooch could, by some
means or other, be recovered.</p>

<p>“And now I am up against it,” he went on,
still communing with himself, after he had left
Ruth. “I can’t get the boys to help me, so I’ve
got to go alone. And what’s the first thing to be
done?”</p>

<p>There were several points that needed clearing
up.</p>

<p>“In the first place,” reasoned Tom, “if Mendez
had the brooch, which was in the jewel box,
he has, or had, the other things. The question is&mdash;has
he them yet? If he sold Boswell the pin he
may have sold the other articles. I guess the only
thing for me to do is to try and get in his shack&mdash;when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
he’s not home. It would be a ticklish piece
of work to stumble in there, and be searching
about, and have him find me. I wonder if I can
get in when he’s out? He does go out quite
often.”</p>

<p>Tom went on to camp, and his absentmindedness
caused his chums no little wonder, until Sid
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s all right&mdash;Tom’s got the symptoms.”</p>

<p>“What symptoms?” demanded our hero.</p>

<p>“The love symptoms. A lovers’ quarrel made
up is worse than falling in at first. Look out!”
for Tom had shied a shoe at his tormentor.</p>

<p>“Practice to-day,” announced Frank, the next
morning. “Mr. Pierson said he’d be over early
and we’ve got to go down and get the shell. He’s
going to put us through a course of sprouts to-day.”</p>

<p>“All right,” yawned Tom, with a fine appearance
of indifference. “But I’ve got to mix the
stuff for cake if I’m going to bake it.” He had
promised to show his skill in pastry-making. “So
if you fellows will go down and get the shell I’ll
be ready when you come back.”</p>

<p>“Three of us can’t row a four-oared shell,”
protested Sid.</p>

<p>“Well, tow it up by the launch, then. I’m not
going to have the cake spoiled.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” declared Frank. “The cook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
is a sacred person. We’ll tow up the shell,” and
they went off, never suspecting their chum.</p>

<p>And how Tom had dissembled! The making
of the cake, he knew, had only been a subterfuge,
for he had made up his mind he would buy one at
the store, and offer some excuse to his chums that
the camp-made one had “fallen” which, I believe,
is the technical word to use when the top of a
cake displays a tendency to lie on the bottom
of the pan, and not stand up properly. I was
once a camp cook, and some of my friends are still
alive to bear witness against me.</p>

<p>Now what Tom planned was this: As soon as
his chums were out of the way he decided to enter
the Mexican’s shack, having learned the evening
before, by skillful questioning, that Mendez had
some work to do around a distant cottage, and
would be away all morning.</p>

<p>“And we’ll see what I can find there,” murmured
Tom, as he set out.</p>

<p>It was an easy matter to enter the shack, at
least that part where the Mexican lived. The
store section was closed, but Tom knew there was
an entrance to it through the main shack.</p>

<p>A carelessly-fastened window gave admittance,
and soon after his chums had departed to get the
shell (which was kept now in the new college
boathouse, that structure having been nearly completed),
Tom found himself inside the shack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>He began rummaging about, taking care not to
unduly disturb objects. Tom was looking in a
trunk, that appeared to contain some clothing, as
well as some of the Mexican drawn-work, and
some silks and satins, when he heard a noise outside.</p>

<p>“Someone is coming!” he whispered. “I’ve
got to hide!” and he made a dive under the cot.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>THE PAWN TICKETS</small></h2>


<p>“Well, I’m certainly going to be in a nice
pickle if that’s Mendez coming back,” thought
Tom, as he gave the blanket on the cot a surreptitious
pull to better conceal his person. “I guess
I was seven kinds of a chump to come here. I
ought to have told the fellows, and then one of
them could have done sentry duty for me. As it is,
if anyone comes in here I’m as good as caught. A
nice story it will make, too&mdash;a Randall man found
in a caretaker’s shack.”</p>

<p>He listened intently, and heard the approaching
steps pause outside the door. Then came a
key rattling in the lock.</p>

<p>“Just my luck,” murmured Tom. “It’s Mendez
coming back. That job didn’t last as long as
I thought it would, or else he’s forgotten something.
Whew! If he sees me there’ll be a fight
all right. He’ll take me for a burglar, sure, or
else he’ll know why I’m here. I wonder if all
Mexicans carry knives? There isn’t much here
for a fellow to defend himself with.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom peered out from under the cot, and made
up his mind, if worst came to worst, that he would
roll out, and grab up the heavy stove poker he
saw.</p>

<p>“That will make a pretty good club,” he reasoned.
“Hang it all! why didn’t I tell the fellows?
If this Mendez does me up he may hide
my body here, and the fellows will never know
what became of me. I ought to have told them&mdash;and
yet I did it this way to keep Ruth’s secret. I
meant it for the best.”</p>

<p>Again Tom listened. The fumbling at the lock
of the door continued.</p>

<p>“If that’s Mendez he doesn’t seem to know
how to open his own door,” mused Tom. “Maybe
he’s got the wrong key.”</p>

<p>This seemed to be so, for there was a jingling
as of several keys, and then a voice was heard to
mutter. Tom started in his hiding place under the
cot.</p>

<p>“That’s not the voice of Mendez!” he exclaimed.
“What am I up against?”</p>

<p>A wild idea came to him.</p>

<p>“Maybe some of our fellows got wise to the
same thing I did, and they’re trying to get in here,”
he thought. “If they see me there’ll be a surprise,”
and he smiled grimly.</p>

<p>The unknown person outside the shack seemed
to be trying a number of keys, one after the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
in the lock. At the same time there was an impatient
muttering.</p>

<p>“That’s not Mendez,” decided Tom. “And
from the voice it’s none of our fellows, either. I
wonder if it can be Boswell?”</p>

<p>The complications that might ensue if it was
the rich student, who seemed to be sharing some
secret with the Mexican, kept Tom busy thinking
for a few seconds, and then his attention was further
drawn toward the person outside.</p>

<p>“Hang it all!” exclaimed a voice in nasal
tones&mdash;plainly the voice of an elderly man&mdash;“he’s
got some newfangled kind of a lock on here, and
I can’t get in. I wonder if a window is open?”</p>

<p>There was the rattle of a bunch of keys being
returned to a pocket, and then the sound of footsteps
coming around to the side of the shack.</p>

<p>“He’s going to try my game,” thought Tom.</p>

<p>“Well if it isn’t Mendez it’s someone who hasn’t
any more right in here than I have, and I’m not
in so much danger. But who can it be?”</p>

<p>There was a struggle at the window, the sound
of a fall, as if the attempt to enter had failed.
Then came muttered words of anger and pain,
and they were followed by the sound of feet beating
a tattoo on the side of the shack.</p>

<p>“He’s scrambling up to the window,” thought
Tom, pulling the cot blankets farther down.
A moment later someone dropped down inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the shack, and remained quietly in the middle of
the floor, as though taking a survey of the place.</p>

<p>“Humph! It ain’t much changed from when
I was here last,” a voice said, and Tom peered
out from beneath a cautiously-raised blanket. The
identity of the unexpected visitor startled him.</p>

<p><a href="#image03">“Old Jake Blasdell!” murmured Tom, in a
whisper.</a> “The former caretaker! What in the
world does he want here? I thought he had
cleared out of these diggings.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_191">“OLD JAKE BLASDELL!” MURMURED TOM, IN A WHISPER.</a></div>
</div>

<p>Blasdell, for it was he, stood in the middle of
the room of the shack where Mendez cooked, ate
and slept&mdash;did everything, in fact, save conduct
his small store, which was an addition.</p>

<p>“It’s better than when I had it,” Blasdell murmured,
for, as I have said, when Mendez succeeded
the former caretaker he had moved the
shack from the place where Blasdell had built it,
and had considerably improved it. “Much better,”
went on the old man. “Them Mexicans
ain’t so lazy as I’ve heard. Lucky for me I
knowed of that window that didn’t close very
tight or I mightn’t have gotten in. And lucky I
happened to see Mendez as I did, and learned
that he would be away all day. Now I’m in here
where can I hide ’em. I don’t dare carry ’em
around with me much longer. Folks is beginning
to suspect. And I’ll take away that piece I left
here, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“What in the world am I stacking up against?”
thought the puzzled Tom. He looked out eagerly.
Blasdell’s back was turned toward the cot, but the
old man did not appear to have anything to hide.</p>

<p>“Can he be out of his mind?” thought Tom.</p>

<p>He heard the man fumbling about, but from his
position could not see what he was doing, and Tom
dared not put out his head from under the cot.</p>

<p>“There, I guess nobody’ll think of lookin’ for
’em there,” went on the old man. “I s’pose mebby
I ought t’ destroy ’em, but they may come in
useful some time or other. I’ll leave ’em here,
and take away that trinket.”</p>

<p>Then came a sound as if the man had stepped
down off a chair, or bench. Tom wished he could
see what he had done, but at least he knew that
something had been hidden on that side of the
room were the stove was.</p>

<p>“Now I wonder if I can get out of the consarned
window?” the man murmured. Tom
heard him cross the room, and, after a struggle,
there came the sound of a jump on the earth outside.</p>

<p>“He’s gone!” murmured Tom, as he listened
to the retreating footsteps. Then he scrambled
out from under the cot, and began making a hasty
search of the room.</p>

<p>If he had hoped to find Ruth’s pin, the cups
from Boxer Hall or any of the missing jewelry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Tom was disappointed. He made a thorough,
but quick, search, not only in the shack proper, but
in the store, though he knew Blasdell had not
gone in there.</p>

<p>“What could he have hidden?” thought Tom.
“I’ve got to get out of here soon, or the fellows
will be waiting for me.”</p>

<p>He saw a small wooden clock on the mantle
over the stove. An idea came to him.</p>

<p>“Maybe that clock hides a secret hole in the
wall,” he thought. Stepping on a chair he moved
the timepiece. As he did so the door came open,
and in the lower part, where swung the pendulum,
he saw several bits of paper. There was no
hole in the wall, but, wonderingly Tom picked up
the papers. Then he started.</p>

<p>“Pawn tickets!” he cried, “and some of them
for silver cups! I’m on the trail at last!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</a><br />
<small>TWO MISSING MEN</small></h2>


<p>“Well, what do you know about that?”</p>

<p>“So that’s where you sneaked off to when we
went after the shell?”</p>

<p>“And that’s why you didn’t bake the cake?”</p>

<p>Tom’s three chums gave expression to these
sentiments as they looked over the bunch of pawn
tickets he had brought away with him from the
Mexican’s shack. A hasty glance through them
had shown Tom that none was for a brooch, and
realizing that he could still keep Ruth’s secret, he
had decided to tell his friends the whole story.
Which he did, keeping back only as much as was
necessary not to let them know of Ruth’s loss.</p>

<p>He related how he had overheard a “certain”
conversation between Boswell and the Mexican,
hurrying over that part of the story so they might
not ask what the talk was about. Then he told
of his own and Blasdell’s visits to the shack.</p>

<p>“Say, this beats anything I ever heard of!”
declared Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s right, but what did the old beggar
hide&mdash;if anything?” asked Sid.</p>

<p>“The pawn tickets, of course,” declared Phil.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure of that, of course,” spoke Tom.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see him, for I couldn’t look out far
enough from under the cot. But he was certainly
on that side of the room. And he didn’t hide the
cups and jewelry, for they’re in pawn, as these
tickets show. So it must have been the tickets.”</p>

<p>“Then if he had the tickets he took the stuff!”
declared Sid.</p>

<p>“Not necessarily,” objected Frank. “The
Mexican and this Blasdell may be in partnership
in crime. Either or both may have taken the
jewelry, and Blasdell may have pawned it. Anyhow,
I think this lets Boswell out, and I’m glad
of it.”</p>

<p>“So am I!” exclaimed Tom, and yet he wondered
what the rich student and the Mexican
could have in common, and he wondered about the
old-fashioned brooch he had seen flashing in the
sun, when the two talked in the boat. Also he
wondered what Boswell wanted of another like it.
In fact Tom was doing considerable wondering,
and it was a puzzle in the solution of which he
could not ask his chums’ aid.</p>

<p>“So that’s why you wanted us to go get the
shell, and leave you here; is it?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“Yes, I wanted time to investigate, and I didn’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
want you fellows to give me the ha ha! if nothing
came of it.”</p>

<p>“But lots did come of it!” declared Frank.
“We can clear ourselves of the faint suspicion
that I believe Boxer Hall thinks hangs over us,
and we can get them back their trophy cups, and
the other people their jewelry.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose the pawnbroker can be made to
give up stolen stuff,” said Tom. He was puzzling
his brains to think of some reason why Ruth’s
brooch was not pawned with the other things.
Recalling the list of missing articles, given out
when the jeweler offered the reward, it was seen
that all were represented by the pawn tickets, save
Ruth’s trinket.</p>

<p>“They’re made out in the name ‘A. Smith,’”
said Phil, as he scrutinized the bits of paper.
“Might be a blacksmith for all you can tell&mdash;probably
a fake name. And the pawnbroker’s
place is in Munroe,” he went on, naming a town
about twenty-five miles away.</p>

<p>“Well,” spoke Tom, “I suppose the thing to
do is to go there, see the police, get the stuff, and
return it to the jeweler. Then he can do as he
likes with it.”</p>

<p>“Incidentally we’ll collect the reward,” declared
Sid.</p>

<p>“We’ll donate it to the new racing association,”
suggested Frank. “Wouldn’t it be a joke, if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
did take that part of the reward offered by Boxer
Hall, and use it to help beat them in the race!”</p>

<p>“Sort of adding insult to injury,” suggested
Tom. “But I’m thinking we ought to let the
Boxer Hall lads know about these tickets, and
that there’s a prospect of them getting back their
trophies.”</p>

<p>There were two opinions about this. Tom and
Sid were one side, while Frank and Phil held it
would be better to first get the stuff and then let
Boxer Hall know.</p>

<p>“‘There’s many a slip ’twixt the cup and the
lip,’ you know, Tom,” said the Big Californian.
“Not meaning a pun, either. But there may be
some complications and it may take some time to
get the stuff away from the pawnbroker. A delay
would only fret all those who have lost things,
and would be unpleasant for us. Get the stuff
first, I say, and then hand it around.”</p>

<p>And in the end this idea prevailed.</p>

<p>“Well, I can see where we get in precious little
practice to-day,” remarked Tom. “I think we’d
all better go to Haddonfield and give these tickets
to Mr. Farson. Let him get the police busy.”</p>

<p>“All right, we’re with you,” said Phil. “But
we need the practice, for it won’t be long now before
we’re back at college.”</p>

<p>“What about arresting Blasdell and the Mexican?”
asked Sid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let the jeweler attend to that,” suggested
Frank.</p>

<p>Without telling the girls of their discovery, the
boys went to town in their launch, which, for a
wonder, did not break down. Frank declared it
was because he had put in a new set of batteries.</p>

<p>That Mr. Farson was astonished, is putting it
mildly. He could not thank the boys enough.
Privately, to Tom, who managed to get him a
word in secret, the jeweler said he could not account
for Ruth’s pin not being represented by a
ticket.</p>

<p>“But I’ll look all through that pawnbroker’s
stock for it,” he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Farson decided that they would first go to
Munroe and get the cups and jewelry, and later see
about causing the arrest of the guilty person, or
persons.</p>

<p>“The pawnbroker would have to identify the
thief, anyhow,” he explained. “Now you boys
go back to the island and stay there. I’ll hire an
auto and go to Munroe. As soon as I get back
I’ll run over and let you know how I make out.
Oh, this is good news for me!”</p>

<p>“What became of Blasdell after he jumped
out of the shack, Tom?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“How could I tell? I was under the cot.”</p>

<p>“That’s so. And he doesn’t seem to be around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
these diggings any more. He just showed up with
these pawn tickets, and then lit out again. And
to think he was the fellow who had the stuff all
the while!”</p>

<p>“He or Mendez,” said Tom. “I’m not sure
which. It’s queer that Blasdell should come all
the way back to hide the tickets in the shack. I
heard him speak of getting something that belonged
to him, but I don’t know what it was.”</p>

<p>They argued the matter, but could come to no
agreement. Going back to their island camp, they
found time for a little practice in the shell, Mr.
Pierson coaching them. Then they waited impatiently
for the return of the jeweler.</p>

<p>“I wonder what Mendez will think when he
gets back and finds his place has been ransacked?”
suggested Sid.</p>

<p>“He won’t know it,” declared Tom. “I was
mighty careful, and Blasdell wasn’t inside more
than a few minutes. Let’s take a stroll around
there, and size it up.”</p>

<p>“No, keep away,” decided Frank. “It might
make trouble. Let’s wait until Mr. Farson
comes.”</p>

<p>It was nearly dusk when they saw a small
launch approaching the island, and they recognized
the jeweler as one of the occupants.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t seem very joyous,” remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Tom. “He isn’t waving his hat, or anything like
that.”</p>

<p>Somehow his words brought a feeling of
doubt to his chums, yet they could not tell why.
Nearer came the launch. It drew up to the little
dock the boys had made.</p>

<p>“Well?” queried Tom, nervously. “How did
you make out?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” was the surprising reply.</p>

<p>“What! Didn’t you get the things?” demanded
Phil.</p>

<p>“No. The pawnbroker closed out his place of
business last week, and the store is vacant.”</p>

<p>For a moment no one spoke. Then Frank said:</p>

<p>“But look here. You know a pawnbroker has
to be licensed. He can’t go out of business that
way. He may move, but he has to let people
know about it. And he can’t dispose of their
things inside of a year, either. That man had no
right to do that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about his rights,” said the
jeweler, “but the fact remains that he has skipped
out. He may have taken the cups and jewelry
with him for all I know. The police say he was
a sort of ‘fence’ through which stolen property
was often disposed of. He’s been arrested several
times, but nothing could be proved against him.”</p>

<p>“What did you do?” asked Sid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“The police in Munroe promised to try and
trace him. I’m going to have circulars printed,
too, and sent to other cities, asking for news of
this pawnbroker.”</p>

<p>“Say, this is tough, to almost get the stuff and
then lose it!” remarked Phil. “It’s a good thing
we didn’t tell the Boxer Hall lads.”</p>

<p>“That’s what,” declared Tom.</p>

<p>“Fellows, I’ve got an idea!” exclaimed Sid.</p>

<p>“Chain it so it doesn’t get away,” advised
Frank.</p>

<p>“I say let’s go to that Mexican’s shack, and see
if we can get anything out of him,” went on Sid.
“We got on the trail there, and he must be mixed
up in it some way. Come on, Mr. Farson, you’ve
got a right to question him.”</p>

<p>“I believe I will!” decided the jeweler, and he
followed the lads toward the shack, through the
lengthening shadows.</p>

<p>“I guess he isn’t home,” remarked Tom, as
they saw no light in the place.</p>

<p>“Knock and see,” suggested Phil.</p>

<p>A tap on the door brought no response. Tom
peered a bit closer.</p>

<p>“The place isn’t closed,” he exclaimed. He
pushed open the door. Someone struck a match.
Then came an exclamation of surprise from all.</p>

<p>For there was evidence that Mendez had hastily
fled. The room was in confusion, things being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
scattered about, and a look into the store showed
that everything he had had for sale had been
removed. Mendez was missing, as was the pawnbroker
and the jewelry.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</a><br />
<small>BACK AT RANDALL</small></h2>


<p>“This is the limit!”</p>

<p>“Where could he have gone?”</p>

<p>“He smelt a rat all right&mdash;he’s sure mixed up
in this business.”</p>

<p>“And the quiet way he sneaked off! Let’s find
out if anyone saw him go.”</p>

<p>Thus the chums exclaimed as the queer situation
dawned upon them. Mr. Farson, too, was surprised,
and did not know what to make of it.</p>

<p>“I think I will devote all my efforts to locating
the pawnbroker,” he said. “If I get the stuff
back that belongs to other persons, I don’t care
so much about an arrest.”</p>

<p>“But we’d like to solve the mystery, seeing that
we had a hand in it,” said Tom. “I wonder
where Mendez could have gone?”</p>

<p>But no one knew&mdash;no one had seen him go.
Later that evening, when the young men, after the
jeweler had gone to his store, made inquiries of
the owner of the cottage where the Mexican had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
been working all that day, they were told by a
servant that a boy, coming in a boat, had brought
a message to the caretaker. He had seemed surprised,
and had hurried off, leaving his work
partly finished, promising to return. But he did
not, and that was the last seen of him&mdash;at least
for the time being.</p>

<p>Evidently he had taken alarm at something, had
hurried to the shack, hastily packed up his belongings,
and fled in a boat. In fact the rowboat he
generally used was missing.</p>

<p>As far as it went there was nothing criminal in
his actions. There was no direct connection between
him and the missing jewelry. He bore a
good reputation among the cottagers, and had
always done his work well. He was honest in his
dealings, and his word could be taken in regard to
the things he sold. Some of the cottagers even
owed him for work performed.</p>

<p>“It’s another mystery connected with this
strange affair,” said Tom, as he and his chums
turned in for the night. “We may get to the
bottom of it some day.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” murmured Frank. “We’ve been
doing more detective work than rowing of late.
We’ll have to buckle down from now on. College
opens in three weeks.”</p>

<p>Of course the flight of Mendez was known to
the girls, as well as to all others on the island, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the circumstances connected with it, and the finding
of the pawn tickets, was kept a secret.</p>

<p>I say from all, but that is not quite correct.
Tom did tell Ruth all, and they both puzzled over
the fact that there was no ticket for the brooch.
But Tom did not tell Ruth what he had overheard
between Boswell and Mendez.</p>

<p>“It might be Ruth’s brooch that Boswell bought
of Mendez, for his mother,” reasoned Tom. “If
Ruth thought so she might make a fuss and insist
on having it back. Then, again, it might not be
hers, and that would make trouble. I’ve got to
investigate a little more before I tell her.”</p>

<p>The Boswell family closed up their cottage the
next week, and left for their mountain home,
where the rich lad and his parents were to spend
the rest of the vacation.</p>

<p>Our boys put in some hard practice in the shell,
once or twice getting enough rowers so that they
could use the eight. Mr. Pierson gave them valuable
coaching.</p>

<p>Then, on his advice, they gave themselves up
to a good rest, and the enjoyment of camp life.</p>

<p>“You’ll want a week or two when you don’t
see an oar,” he explained. “There is such a thing
as overdoing it. And you will soon be back at
college you say, and begin hard training. So take
a rest now.”</p>

<p>And the boys did, though their “rest” consisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
chiefly in giving the girls a good time. The
wheezy little launch was worked to the limit.</p>

<p>Then came the approach of the college season.
Several cottages on the island were closed. The
girls said farewell to Madge, for they must spend
some time with their own folks, and one day Tom
remarked:</p>

<p>“Say, fellows, let’s break camp. It’s no fun
here without the girls.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Sid, and so the tents
were struck, and our heroes went their several
ways to enjoy what was left of their vacation before
again gathering at Randall. And in that
time nothing new developed about the missing
cups and jewelry. Nor was any word heard of
the pawnbroker or Mendez.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Hello, there’s Dutch Housenlager, bigger
than ever!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and there’s Bricktop redder than ever.
I say, Brick!”</p>

<p>“Hello, Parsons, you look as brown as a berry.
What have you been doing with yourself?”</p>

<p>“Camping.”</p>

<p>“You look it. I was at the shore&mdash;beastly
hot, too!”</p>

<p>“Say, isn’t the new boathouse swell?”</p>

<p>“Nothing like it. Oh, it’s going to be great at
Randall this Fall.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“Over this way, Henderson! Where’s Phil
and Frank?” cried Tom.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I just got in. Have you been
up to the room?”</p>

<p>“No, I just landed, too. Have you fed your
face?”</p>

<p>“Not since I got here. Let’s grub and then
we’ll open up the place. Hi, there, Snail! How’s
the night work?”</p>

<p>“Oh, so-so,” replied Sam Looper, re-christened
“Snail,” because of his slowness, and his propensity
for night prowling.</p>

<p>“Here come the Jersey twins!”</p>

<p>“That’s right. I hope Jerry makes a good
coxswain in the varsity eight,” went on Tom.
“We need him.”</p>

<p>“Hear you did some practicing this Summer,”
remarked Dutch, as he playfully dug his elbow
into Tom’s ribs.</p>

<p>“We did. I’m anxious to get hold of an oar
again. Have the new shells come?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t heard. We’ll inquire. I saw Mr.
Lighton a bit ago.”</p>

<p>It was the opening of Randall College for the
Fall term, and our friends, as well as their chums,
had returned not only to lessons but to sports as
well&mdash;cross-country running, football&mdash;ever glorious
football&mdash;and now and chiefly, rowing, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the regatta was to be held before the big battles
of the gridiron took place.</p>

<p>“Come on!” cried Tom, as he spied his three
chums. “Let’s slip up to our room and talk
things over.”</p>

<p>This was after a more or less hurried meal had
been eaten.</p>

<p>“And we sure have lots to talk about,” remarked
Sid. “But let’s get through with it and
take a run up to Fairview. I guess&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You guess the girls are there&mdash;that’s what
you guess!” interrupted Tom. “Hark to him,
fellows. Isn’t he the limit!”</p>

<p>And then, linking arms, the four inseparables
strolled across the campus, through groups of
students, toward their room.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />
<small>THE NEW SHELLS</small></h2>


<p>“Say, aren’t they beauts!”</p>

<p>“All to the cream!”</p>

<p>“Nothing like ’em ever seen on this river before!”</p>

<p>“And look at the eight! Isn’t that a peach?”</p>

<p>“Easy there, Housenlager, that isn’t a ferry-boat!”
and Jerry Jackson kept the big lad from
stepping into the new eight-oared shell. The
other exclamations, as may easily be surmised,
came from the college lads as they gathered about
the new float and boathouse, in front of which
were the new craft that had been put in the water
that day. It was a week or so after the opening
of Randall, and matters were shaping themselves
up in some kind of order.</p>

<p>“Two fours, four singles, two doubles and the
eight!” remarked Tom. “Say, that committee of
old grads certainly did themselves proud all right!”</p>

<p>“They sure did,” agreed Sid.</p>

<p>“And this boathouse can’t be beat!” added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Phil, as he and the others inspected the new structure.</p>

<p>“I only hope that same thing applies to our
boats,” remarked the Big Californian, grimly.
“There’ll be something coming to us if they
can’t be beaten.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get in and have a trial,” suggested Sid.
“Come, we’ve got enough for two eights&mdash;one
crew in the old shell and one in the new. We’ll
find out if she’s stiff enough.”</p>

<p>“Better wait until Mr. Lighton gives the
word,” suggested Tom. “They’ll want to soak
up a bit, anyhow, being new; and our weight might
open up the seams too much.”</p>

<p>In fact the boats had only been in the water
since that morning, a committee of the rowing
association superintending their removal from the
freight station on trucks.</p>

<p>The letter announcing that they were on their
way had been received some little time before,
and the advent of the rowing craft was eagerly
waited. Then had come a simple ceremony, when
a committee of the presenting graduates had formally
turned over the boathouse and outfit to Randall
College.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll have to organize soon, pick out a
coxswain and captain, and arrange for hard training,”
said Tom.</p>

<p>“Yes, there isn’t much time between now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the football season,” agreed Frank. “Boxer Hall
and Fairview will want to wind up the rowing
game as early as they can. It’s been a double drill
for them, since they raced in the Spring. Next
Spring we’ll get in the game with them.”</p>

<p>“Here comes Mr. Lighton,” suggested Sid.
“Maybe he’ll have something to say,” and he indicated
the coach coming down toward the boathouse.</p>

<p>“Well, boys, how do you like them?” asked
Mr. Lighton, as he indicated the new craft.</p>

<p>“Swell!”</p>

<p>“Peachy!”</p>

<p>“Pippy!”</p>

<p>These were only a sample of the many expressions
of approval.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll slip in one of those singles and
have a try at it,” remarked Boswell, starting for
the dressing rooms to change into rowing costume.</p>

<p>“No, don’t, please&mdash;not just yet,” said Mr.
Lighton. “I want to look them over first, to see
if there are any flaws. You can take out one of
the old ones.”</p>

<p>“Say, you don’t seem to want me to do anything
in the boating line!” exclaimed the rich lad.
“You shifted me out of the eight, and now you
don’t want me to practice in a single. I tell you
I know something about a boat&mdash;I’ve done as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
much work this Summer as those fellows,” and he
indicated Tom and his three chums.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” responded Mr. Lighton,
quietly. “I’m not denying that, but I want you
to understand that I did not shift you out of the
eight without good reason, and there is still time
for you to try to make good&mdash;even yet.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m going to stick to the single&mdash;and I’m
going to win!” snapped Boswell.</p>

<p>“Good&mdash;I hope you do,” assented the coach.
“Now, boys, we’ve got to get together, select a
captain for the varsity, also the coxswain, as well
as officials, and rowers for the other boats. It
won’t do to go at this slip-shod fashion. What
do you say to a meeting to-night to select the officials?”</p>

<p>“Good!” came the general cry, and then matters
were talked over at length. As far as arrangements
with Boxer Hall and Fairview were
concerned, they had been practically completed in
the Spring. All that remained was the selection
of the day for the regatta, the marking of the
course, the settlement of rules, which would be
practically the same as those governing Boxer Hall
and Fairview, and the selecting of the officials.</p>

<p>The other two colleges had very little to do to
get ready for the races, but Randall had considerable.
However, under the guidance of Mr. Lighton,
affairs soon shaped up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>There was some wire-pulling in regard to the
election of a varsity captain, but the choice eventually
fell upon Frank Simpson, who pulled stroke.
It met with general approval, for all liked the Big
Californian, and no one who had been tried at
stroke did anywhere nearly as well as did he.
For coxswain the choice fell upon Jerry Jackson&mdash;in
fact there was no opposition, for many who
might have liked to try for it, felt that they were
not equal to the responsibility. But Jerry seemed
to fit in there naturally. He was just the right
weight, Mr. Lighton said; he had a certain delicacy,
yet firmness, in steering, and he could use
judgment.</p>

<p>As for the singles, their disposition was simple.
A number of lads signified their desire to
enter into a competition among themselves, the
best to be picked to meet Boxer Hall and Fairview
contestants. Boswell was to be one who would
enter the elimination trials, and he accepted the
responsibility with an air of confidence that caused
much secret amusement, and no little disgust.
Snail Looper also expressed a desire to try, as did
a number of others.</p>

<p>In the doubles a number of new lads, with whom
we are not immediately concerned, entered, and
as for the fours, some juniors and sophomores, together
with a few freshmen, made up three combinations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the best one of which was to meet the
rivals.</p>

<p>“As for the eight,” said Mr. Lighton, “which
craft, in a measure will be regarded as the main
varsity boat, we now have two crafts&mdash;the old
one and the new. I suggest that there be elimination
trials, and several friendly races between the
two crews.</p>

<p>“In this way not only will you get practice, but
you will have experience in pulling against another
boat, which will stand you in good stead.</p>

<p>“I have also to announce that Mr. Pierson,
whom some of you know as the old Cornell oarsman,
has kindly consented to help me in coaching
you. We will draw up a set of training rules, and
I expect every man to follow them faithfully.
Otherwise there is no use in going into this thing.
Remember the condition of this magnificent gift
to Randall was that she should prove herself a
victor.”</p>

<p>“And she will!” cried Tom, while the others
echoed his words.</p>

<p>There remained a few other preliminaries to
arrange, and minor officials to select, and then the
meeting of the athletic committee ended.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say!” cried Phil, at the conclusion. “I
wonder if it’s too late to go see the girls?”</p>

<p>“Guess not,” agreed Tom. “I’m with you.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” echoed Frank and Phil, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
hurried to catch a trolley for Fairview Institute.</p>

<p>As they walked up the steps to the building
where the young ladies were permitted to receive
visitors, they saw a lad standing there. Just as
Tom was about to ring the bell, the door opened,
and a maid announced to the waiting lad:</p>

<p>“Miss Clinton can see no one.”</p>

<p>“She is out, do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. That was the message Miss
Philock told me to give you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” and, turning so that the light
from the hall shone on his face, the countenance
of Boswell was disclosed to our friends.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he exclaimed blankly, as he recognized
them. Then looking at Tom he added:</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’ll have better luck than I did,
Parsons!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” admitted Tom, drily.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</a><br />
<small>“ROW HARD!”</small></h2>


<p>The four chums watched Boswell go down the
steps and get into a waiting auto, the maid, meanwhile,
regarding them half curiously, for she
knew them well, from frequent visits.</p>

<p>“Some class to him,” remarked Sid.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s finding his way here all right,”
added Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a free country,” added Phil. “He
came to see Ruth, if I’m any judge.”</p>

<p>“And got turned down,” added Frank.</p>

<p>“I wonder if the girls are really out?” ventured
Tom.</p>

<p>“I’ll see if the young ladies are in,” remarked
the maid. She did not have to ask which young
ladies were meant.</p>

<p>She returned shortly to say that, while it was
almost too late for visitors, Miss Philock had consented
that the four chums could see their friends
for ten minutes.</p>

<p>“Say, what’s gotten into the old Ogress&mdash;she’s
so pleasant to us?” Sid wanted to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“Probably this is the calm before the storm,”
suggested Phil. “We may be turned down after
this, the same as Boswell was.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what he wanted?” mused Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, probably to ask the best way to darn
socks without tying a string around the hole,”
suggested Frank, with delicate sarcasm.</p>

<p>“Here come the girls!” exclaimed Tom, and
the murmur of voices bore out his remark.</p>

<p>While the conversation that followed was probably
of intense and absorbing personal interest to
those who took part in it, there was not enough of
general interest to warrant me setting it down
here. Sufficient to say that all sorts of matters,
from the coming regatta to the opening of the
football season, were discussed, and commented
upon. Needless to say the Fairview girls, with
commendable loyalty, declared that their college
was going to be the champions of the gridiron and
river.</p>

<p>Tom found chance for a quiet word with Ruth
just before the ringing of a warning bell announced
that visiting hours were nearly over. She
explained that it was a surprise to her when Boswell
called, and she and her chums decided not to
meet him.</p>

<p>“I haven’t found out anything more about your
pin,” Tom said. “That is, I haven’t located it,”
for he did not want to go into details about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
missing pawnbroker and Mendez. Nothing more
had been heard of either.</p>

<p>“Too bad,” Ruth declared. “I suppose,
though, I might as well keep quiet about the loss
of it until some one of my folks notice that it’s
gone,” she said. “It will be time enough then
to confess, though I suppose I’ll be in for a wigging
from grandmother for keeping still about it
so long.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it can’t do any harm to keep quiet now,”
decided Tom, “and something may turn up at
any minute.”</p>

<p>“Then you really have some hope, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;a little,” he admitted. “But I can’t
talk about it, Ruth. It involves others.”</p>

<p>“Oh, tell me Tom! I’ll keep it a secret!” she
pleaded.</p>

<p>“No, really I can’t,” he said, and though she
made it rather hard for him, he kept to his resolve.</p>

<p>“It is time your friends left, young ladies!”
announced the rather rasping voice of Miss
Philock, a little later. “I have been lenient with
you to the extent of ten minutes, but now I must
insist.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for your kindness,” exclaimed
Phil, with a low bow. “We greatly appreciate it.”</p>

<p>“I am glad that you do,” declared the preceptress,
not allowing a smile to change the hard contour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of her face. Poor Miss Philock! Doubtless
she did not have a happy time of it, and her
responsibilities must have weighed on her. It
is not an easy task to be the dragon, guarding a
number of pretty girls, when two colleges for
young men are not far off. And Miss Philock did
her duty, however unpleasant it was.</p>

<p>Tom was awakened that night, shortly after one
o’clock. At least he judged it to be about that
hour, for he dimly recalled hearing a distant clock
booming out twelve; then he had fallen into a
doze, and it could not have been over an hour later
when a noise and movement in the main apartment,
out of which all their rooms opened, roused
him.</p>

<p>“Wonder who that is?” he thought, sleepily.
“Maybe we did a little too much to-day, and some
of the boys can’t rest. I’ll take a look.”</p>

<p>He raised himself upon his elbow, but, though
he had a partial view of the sitting room from that
position, he could see no one. The scuffling of
feet on the carpet, however, and the faint rattle of
paper, told that someone was up and about.</p>

<p>Softly Tom put his legs over the edge of the
bed, so that it would not creak, for, somehow, he
had a faint suspicion that perhaps the person in
the other room might not be one of his chums,
and, in that case, he wanted to be prepared.</p>

<p>Gently he stepped out until he stood in the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of his own room, and had a view of the main
apartment. Then he saw a white-robed figure
standing looking out of the window that gave a
view of the campus, over which a faint moon was
then shining.</p>

<p>“That looks like Sid,” thought Tom. “I wonder
if he’s getting spoony&mdash;or loony or moony?
Maybe he couldn’t sleep and got up to change the
current of his thoughts. Well, shall I go out and
keep him company, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Tom reconsidered the matter a moment.</p>

<p>“No,” he thought, “if I go out there, and we
get to chinning, even in whispers, it will rouse
Frank and Phil, and then we’ll all be wide awake.
And the land knows we need all the sleep we
can get. I can find my way to dreamland without
being sung to, anyhow.”</p>

<p>For a moment he watched the figure by the window.
It was Sid, Tom felt sure of that, though
night-garments, be they pajamas or the more prosaic
shirts, do not make for identifying individuals.
There is little of character to them.</p>

<p>Then the figure by the window turned partly
toward Tom, but, as the face was in the shadow,
the watching lad could not see it plainly. The
figure approached the table, on which was a litter
of paper, where the lads had been doing some
studying earlier in the evening.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” thought Tom. “Old Sid is writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
poetry&mdash;or he has been courting the muse! This
is rich! He can’t sleep and he gets up in the night
to jot down a verse or two. That’s it! And
about a girl, too, I’ll wager! Oh, Sid!” and he
chuckled silently. “I’ll rig you for this in the
morning! Loony, spoony, moony Sid! This is
rich!” and Tom doubled up with silent mirth.</p>

<p>The figure continued to approach the table, and
from the other rooms the deep, regular breathing
told of sound sleepers. Then the figure began
fumbling with papers and Tom saw a pencil taken
up.</p>

<p>“How the mischief can he see to write in the
dark?” the watcher wondered.</p>

<p>But that was evidently not the intention. For,
after hesitating a few seconds over the table, the
white-clad figure turned and went out of the door
into the hall.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you make of that?” Tom asked
himself. “He has got ’em bad! Sneaking out to
some other room to write his slushy poetry. He’s
the limit! Wait until we get at him in the daylight&mdash;there
won’t be any loony-moon then. But
I should think he’d want to put on a bath robe.
It isn’t the warmest night of Summer,” added
Tom to himself, being aware of a distinctly chilly
feeling about his legs.</p>

<p>“Wait!” he counseled with himself. “I’ll find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
out about this. I’ll just follow him and give him
a scare. I’ll catch him with the goods.”</p>

<p>Pausing to make sure that none of the others
were awake, and waiting to give Sid a chance to
get a little way down the corridor, Tom slipped
out of the door, his feet encased in a pair of bath
slippers, that lent themselves better to soft movement
than not, for they avoided the scuffling that
always goes with bare soles.</p>

<p>Tom reached the corridor, and, looking down
it, saw at the farther end the white-robed figure.</p>

<p>“He made good time all right,” Tom mused.
“Where can he be going to though, in that rig?
Oh, probably to the reading room,” and Tom recalled
the large room at the end of the hall, a sort
of library fitted up for the use of the dwellers of
the dormitory&mdash;a room seldom used by the way,
for the lads preferred the seclusion of their own
apartments.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s looking for a rhyming dictionary,”
thought Tom. “That’s it. I’m on to his game
now.”</p>

<p>Tom thought he understood it all. Sid, who
used to care nothing for the girls&mdash;indeed having
a veritable aversion for them&mdash;had, of late, been
quite different, as Tom and all the others saw and
knew. There was one in particular&mdash;and it would
not be fair for me to mention her name&mdash;one in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
particular about whom Sid, if he did not talk,
thought much.</p>

<p>“And he’s going to finish out some poem he
began, and got stuck with,” decided Tom. “Probably
he knows we’d rig him if we saw him writing
that Valentine stuff.</p>

<p>“A rhyming dictionary though. I don’t see
what he needs of that. Love, dove, above&mdash;you
true&mdash;eyes of blue. Heart&mdash;part&mdash;die, sigh&mdash;moon&mdash;soon&mdash;spoon&mdash;no,
not that. But hair&mdash;fair&mdash;ever
there&mdash;thine&mdash;mine&mdash;valentine. There
you are, done without the aid of a net, and with
nothing concealed up my sleeve,” mused Tom,
shivering slightly as a chilling breeze from the corridor
not only crept up his arm, but over other
parts of his anatomy.</p>

<p>The figure ahead of him glided on, and Tom
followed. Then, instead of turning into the library,
it mounted a flight of stairs that led to the
rooms above, where other students slept.</p>

<p>“For cats’ sake!” thought Tom. “What is
Sid up to anyhow? Is he going to snare someone
else in on this game? Or is he playing some
trick? The bell in the tower! Jove, if he dares
to ring that at this hour!”</p>

<p>For, when the new dormitory had been built, a
bell had been hung in an ornate corner tower,
though it pealed forth but seldom, being more of
an ornament. Still it could be rung if desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s what old Sid is up to!” decided Tom.
“He must be going daffy. He’s sure to be caught,
for Simond has a room up there, and he’s a light
sleeper.” Simond being one of the new teachers,
who had been assigned to this dormitory as a sort
of moral-policeman. He was, however, a well-liked
instructor.</p>

<p>“I wonder how it would be for me to tip Sid
off not to do it?” thought Tom. “If he does
jingle the chimes they’ll say we all had a hand in
it, and it will be bad for the bunch. I guess I’ll
call him off. No use going too far for a joke.”</p>

<p>Tom was about to sprint forward, when, to his
surprise, the figure turned and entered one of the
student’s rooms, the door opening noiselessly and
closing again as silently.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you know about that?” asked
Tom of himself. “Who rooms there, I wonder?
And what is Sid going in there for? Can it be
that he isn’t up to dashing off a fervid love poem
himself, and has to get someone else, under the
cover of night, to do it for him?”</p>

<p>Tom came to a halt, some distance from the
door that had opened and closed, and remained
gazing down the corridor. He seldom came up
here, and did not know which students occupied
the different rooms. And, as the corridor was
long, and as Tom was looking down it on an
angle, he could not be exactly sure which door had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
opened, they being all alike, and many without
numbers.</p>

<p>“I’ll just stay here and wait,” he decided. “He
can’t stay in there very long,” and then Tom began
to wish he had slipped on his bath robe, for he
was getting more and more chilly each minute.</p>

<p>“Hang it all! Why doesn’t he come out?”
he asked himself half a dozen times. “I’m not
going to stay here all night.”</p>

<p>But even at that, while calling himself all sorts
of a foolish person, Tom remained.</p>

<p>“It’s too good a joke to pass up!” he decided.
“I’ll surprise Sid when he comes out. Poetry!
Bah! We’ll write a love verse for him!”</p>

<p>Several minutes passed. Tom moved about, and
began to do some exercises with his arms, to bring
up his circulation. He was striking out vigorously,
feeling in quite a glow, when his elbow, as he drew
back his arm, came in sharp contact with the door
behind him. Unaware of it, he had been standing
in front of some portal while he waited.</p>

<p>“Oh, for cats’ sake!” thought Tom, in grim
despair as the sound boomed out with startling
distinctness in that dim and silent corridor. “Now
I have gone and done it. I guess I’d better pass
up Sid and his poem, and get back to my little
bed. I wonder if I can make it before someone
sticks out his noddle, and wants to know what I’m
doing here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>With this thought in mind he started to glide
away, but he was too late. The door he had
banged with his elbow suddenly opened, and a
voice demanded in peremptory tones:</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” gasped Tom. “It’s Simond!”
for the countenance of the instructor was thrust
from the half-opened portal.</p>

<p>“Well?” went on the rather grim voice, as
Tom hesitated. “You knocked.”</p>

<p>“It&mdash;it was an accident,” stammered Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh. Then you don’t want me?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Is anything the matter?”</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Simond.”</p>

<p>“Then what are you doing up on this floor?
You’re Parsons, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And you room on the floor below?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then what are you doing up here at this
hour of the night; knocking at my door?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;er&mdash;it was an accident, you see. I was&mdash;I
was exercising.”</p>

<p>“Exercising?” There was a note of incredulity
in the voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, exercising.”</p>

<p>“What for?” Cold sarcasm now took the place
of surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“To keep warm.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Parsons!” exclaimed the instructor.
“You may think this is a joke, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, sir; it’s no joke. I was exercising to keep
warm. Arm exercising you know, and my elbow
banged your door&mdash;I didn’t know I was so close.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, are you warm now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir.” Indeed Tom was in a veritable
rosy glow.</p>

<p>“But what was the necessity of getting cold?”
went on Mr. Simond, and Tom became aware that
others were listening to the talk, for he could hear
doors down the hall cautiously opened, and faint
snickers of laughter here and there.</p>

<p>Tom was in a quandary. He did not want to
tell the real object of coming upstairs as he had,
for it would only make trouble for Sid.</p>

<p>And yet if he kept silent he would be put down
for having tried to play some prank on his own
account. Still if Sid had “gotten away” with
whatever he had attempted, and it seemed so, for
no sound came from the neighborhood of the room
he had entered&mdash;in that case Tom could not bring
him into the game.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ve got to take my medicine,” thought
Tom.</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded Mr. Simond in a cold voice.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I just came up here for a&mdash;for a walk,” explained
Tom. “I&mdash;er&mdash;I couldn’t sleep, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“I see. You thought if you came and waked
me up that you <em>could</em> sleep; is that it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, not at all, Mr. Simond.” He could be
funny when he wanted to, thought shivering Tom.
“I&mdash;er&mdash;I was just going back to bed,” he explained
lamely, for that was true enough.</p>

<p>“Very well, then you’d better go <em>now</em>,” concluded
Mr. Simond. “And don’t knock on any
more doors, or I shall have to look further into
the matter. Good-night!”</p>

<p>“Good-night!” gasped Tom, surprised to be
let off thus easily. “It was all a mistake, I assure
you,” he added, as he glided away.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t <em>repeat</em> the mistake,” was the grim
injunction of the instructor, as he closed his door,
and Tom vowed that he would not&mdash;at least that
night.</p>

<p>“I’m a chump!” he told himself as he hurried
back to his room. “I might better have let Sid
grind out his mushy poetry in peace, and gotten
my sleep. Now I may be in for a lecture to-morrow.”</p>

<p>As he entered the room he saw, grouped in the
middle of the apartment, his three chums. The
sight of Sid, with Phil and Frank, caused Tom to
halt.</p>

<p>“Where in thunder have you been?” demanded
Phil. “We were just going to get up a searching
party for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s right,” came from Sid. “What do you
mean by chasing out at this hour?”</p>

<p>“What do <em>you</em> mean, I guess it is!” exclaimed
Tom. “I’ve been chasing you, Sid.”</p>

<p>“Chasing me? What rot is that?”</p>

<p>“It’s all right. I woke up when I heard you
moving about in here, followed you out to the
corridor. You were going to write a poem, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Say, am I crazy or is he?” demanded Sid,
appealing to the others. “Writing poetry?”</p>

<p>“Yes; weren’t you?” asked Tom, beginning to
think he had more of a mystery on his hands than
he had at first suspected.</p>

<p>“Worse and more of it,” murmured Frank.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me?” demanded Tom,
“that you didn’t sneak out of here a while ago, and
go to one of the rooms on the next floor?” and he
looked defiantly at Sid.</p>

<p>“I certainly won’t tell, or admit, anything of the
kind, because it isn’t so,” replied Sid. “Admitting
that I had, will you kindly explain how <em>I</em> could be
here when <em>you</em> came in; in that case?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted Tom, scratching his head
in perplexity. “Unless,” he added as an afterthought,
“unless you came down the back stairs,
when I was chinning with Simond.”</p>

<p>“Chinning with Simond?” demanded Phil. “Do
you mean to say you were caught by him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. I banged on his door.”</p>

<p>“Banged on his door?”</p>

<p>“Yes, by accident. You see I was exercising to
keep warm.”</p>

<p>The three paused and looked at each other.
Clearly they did not understand.</p>

<p>“Look here, Tom,” began Frank in a gentle,
soothing voice. “How long have you been this
way? Did it come on suddenly, or are you subject
to these fits? Have you seen a doctor? Don’t you
think we’d better wire your folks? Maybe if you
lie down it will wear off. Isn’t it sad, and him so
young, too!” and he sighed in mock distress.</p>

<p>“Look here, you chump!” cried Tom indignantly.
“You think I’m stalling; don’t you? But
I’m not. Here’s how it happened,” and he told
of the circumstances, and of his suspicions against
Sid.</p>

<p>“And while I was waiting for him&mdash;as I
thought&mdash;to come out of that room upstairs,” he
went on, “I got chilly. So I exercised. My elbow
banged on Simond’s door, and he opened the oak.
Then I had to explain.”</p>

<p>“That’s a rich one!” declared Phil.</p>

<p>“He must have thought you were crazy!” said
Frank.</p>

<p>“Exercising at that hour of the night!” exclaimed
Sid. “This is too good to keep!” and he
laughed outright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not so loud,” cautioned Phil, “or we’ll rouse
the place. Anything else, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that enough? But say, Sid, are you sure
you weren’t out?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am. Ask Phil and Frank. They
woke me up in bed.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” chorused the two.</p>

<p>“I heard a noise,” explained Phil, “and woke
up. I was just in time to see you going out of the
room, Tom, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That was when I was after Sid,” Tom explained.</p>

<p>“You mean you thought it was me,” put in Sid.</p>

<p>“Well, have it that way if you like. But if it
wasn’t you I chased, who was it?” demanded
Tom, after the manner of one propounding a difficult
riddle.</p>

<p>“That’s up to you to find out,” spoke the Big
Californian. “Are you sure you <em>did</em> see and follow
someone, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am. Do you think I’m crazy?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was Frank’s simple remark.</p>

<p>“There’s something wrong,” went on Sid, “but
we can’t get to the bottom of it now. If there was
someone in our room we want to know it.”</p>

<p>“Well, there was,” declared Tom, positively.
“<em>I</em> know it!”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, I saw you going out,” resumed Phil.
“I wondered what was up, but I thought maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
you felt sick, and was going to the medicine cabinet
at the end of the corridor. So I went back
to bed, and when you didn’t return in ten minutes
I roused Sid and Frank.”</p>

<p>“And you found Sid in bed?” demanded Tom.</p>

<p>“Sleeping like a babe&mdash;the result of an innocent
conscience. Was it not?” asked Sid, with an
air of virtue.</p>

<p>“Yes, little one,” came from Phil, with a bow.</p>

<p>“Then we all speculated on what could be the
matter with you,” added Frank.</p>

<p>“And we were about to organize a relief expedition,
with six months’ supply of rations, and
start out,” was Sid’s contribution.</p>

<p>“When in you came prancing as though you had
been out for a constitutional,” concluded Phil.</p>

<p>“Telling us that you had been <em>exercising</em>,” commented
Sid, sarcastically. “Talk about following
<em>me</em> in a suspicious manner, I rather think the dancing
slipper is on the other foot, my friend.”</p>

<p>“Well, this gets me!” confessed Tom, blankly.</p>

<p>“Then it’s the second time you’ve been gotten
at this night,” declared Frank. “For Simond had
you first.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he was decent about it,” Tom said. “I
don’t believe anything will come of it. I’m going
to get to bed. It’s as cold as Greenland here,” and
he made a dive for his room.</p>

<p>“What time is it, anyhow?” asked Sid with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
yawn. “Did we take the toothpick out of the
alarm clock, I wonder?”</p>

<p>The three of them glanced toward the table
where the timepiece was wont to tick. It was the
custom to wind and set it before going to bed, the
last one to retire being charged with the duty of
removing the toothpick, which was used to silence
the ticking that annoyed the chums when they were
studying.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why&mdash;it’s gone&mdash;gone!” gasped Tom,
halting on his way to his room.</p>

<p>“That’s right!” chorused the others.</p>

<p>“Tom Parsons, is this your joke?” demanded
Sid, sternly.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean did you take that clock away for a
joke, and then, when you got caught, made up that
fake story about chasing me?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;did&mdash;not!” exclaimed Tom in such a manner
that they could not help believing him.</p>

<p>“Then where is it?” demanded Frank.</p>

<p>There was silence for several seconds, while the
white-clad figures regarded one another. Then
Tom burst out with:</p>

<p>“I have it!”</p>

<p>“I thought you did,” said Sid significantly.</p>

<p>“No, you gump! I mean I have the solution.
It was that chap who was in here, and whom I took
for you, Sid. He has our clock. I’ll get it back!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom was about to rush out into the corridor,
when Frank laid a restraining hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Hold on, son,” he began mildly. “There’s
been enough running around for one night. It
won’t be healthy, for one thing, to do any more,
for it is beastly cold. And, for another, there is
no use in running our heads into a noose. Simond
was decent, you say, Tom, and there’s no sense
in putting it on him&mdash;rubbing it in, so to speak.
We’ll just lay low until morning and then we’ll get
our clock. You say you know where it is?”</p>

<p>“Well, I saw the fellow that was in here enter
some room on the floor above. I couldn’t pick it
out exactly, but I can come pretty near it.”</p>

<p>“That’ll be all right. Who do you think it
was?”</p>

<p>“Dutch Housenlager!” declared Tom.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t room up there,” retorted Phil.</p>

<p>“Well, he may have slipped in some room up
there to throw me off,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“More likely it was Jerry Jackson,” was Frank’s
opinion. “He was poking fun at the clock yesterday.”</p>

<p>“As long as he doesn’t poke anything more than
fun at it, all right,” said Phil. “We’re the only
ones licensed to use toothpicks and battle-axes on
it.”</p>

<p>“Poor old clock,” sighed Sid. “It does get
abused, but still it is a faithful friend. Remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the time that duffer&mdash;what was his name&mdash;took
out some of the wheels to make some machine he
was crazy over? Remember that?”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” exclaimed Tom. “But this
chap wasn’t satisfied with a single wheel&mdash;he wanted
the whole works. I wonder who it could be?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder but what the Snail had a
hand in this,” opined Phil. “He’s so fond of
roaming about nights.”</p>

<p>“He stays over in the North dormitory now,”
declared Frank. “Besides, he wouldn’t get in here
at this hour of the morning&mdash;at least I think it
must be near morning. The doors are locked
after hours, you know. No, it was someone from
here all right, who took that clock.”</p>

<p>“And the nerve of ’em!” exclaimed Phil.</p>

<p>“And to think Tom took that lad&mdash;whoever he
was&mdash;for me,” put in Sid. “Did he really look
like me?”</p>

<p>“He sure did.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it was Bean Perkins,” suggested Frank.</p>

<p>“No, Bean wouldn’t do a trick like that. He
couldn’t keep quiet enough,” declared Tom.
“He’d want to give a class yell or sing a song in
the middle of it, and that would give it away. Say,
but I have a scheme though.”</p>

<p>“Out with it, and then let’s get to bed,” yawned
Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>“We won’t say anything about this,” spoke
Tom, “and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not say anything about it!” cried Sid. “Well,
I guess we will! Think we’re going to let our
clock disappear, and keep mum over it? I guess
not!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean that,” explained Tom. “I
meant that we’d not come out boldly, and admit
that we didn’t know enough to keep our clock from
being taken. But to-morrow&mdash;at chapel&mdash;or whenever
we can, we’ll just sneak up back of Dutch, the
Jersey twins, or whoever else we suspect, and say
‘clock’ to them. That will make the guilty one
start, and we’ll have our man.”</p>

<p>“I see&mdash;a sort of detective stunt,” remarked
Frank.</p>

<p>“Sort of,” admitted Tom.</p>

<p>“How would it do to make a noise like a tick,”
suggested Phil.</p>

<p>“Say, I’m not joking,” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>“Neither am I,” asserted Phil. “But let’s be
real mysterious about it, and we’ll get the guilty
one so much more easily.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be silly!” snapped Tom, who, truth
to tell, was getting a bit short-tempered.</p>

<p>“I’m not!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are!”</p>

<p>“Say, let’s all get back to bed, and fight this
out in the morning,” suggested Frank, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
took his advice, though it was but a troubled sleep
that any of the four got the rest of that night.</p>

<p>Talking it over by daylight they decided that
Tom’s plan might not be so bad. Accordingly,
they put it into practice.</p>

<p>“Clock!” suddenly exclaimed Sid, as he slid
up behind Dutch Housenlager after chapel.
“Tick-tock!”</p>

<p>“Tag. You’re it!” quickly responded Dutch.
“What’s the signal?”</p>

<p>“You’re not guilty, I see,” spoke Sid, with a
sigh.</p>

<p>“Of course not. What’s the answer?”</p>

<p>“Someone took our clock last night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that battered chronometer? Say, do you
know what I thought?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t guess it.”</p>

<p>“That you were trying to initiate me into a new
secret society, and that you were practicing the
password&mdash;tick-tock!”</p>

<p>“Nothing doing. Say, Dutch, if you hear of
anyone who has it, tip me off, will you?”</p>

<p>“I sure will,” and then, to show how much in
earnest he was, Dutch tripped Sid up and deposited
him on the grass of the campus.</p>

<p>Nor was Tom, or his other two chums any
more successful. Each time they tried the surprise
plan on any suspect they received an answer
that told they were on the wrong track.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>And then, most unexpectedly, the clock came
back, as it had done once before. Wallops, the
messenger, brought it.</p>

<p>“I found it down in the furnace room,” he explained.
“It was on top of one of the boilers.”</p>

<p>“Well, for the love of tripe!” cried Tom.
“How in the world did it get there?”</p>

<p>“Our unknown visitor put it there,” declared
Frank. “Maybe he thought we were on his track,
and he took this method of getting rid of the damaging
evidence.”</p>

<p>And they had to let it go at that&mdash;at least for
the time being, for all their inquiries came to
naught.</p>

<p>“Everyone who wants to try for the varsity
eight come down to the river this afternoon,” was
the notice Captain Simpson posted on the bulletin
board the next day. He and the coach had had
a conference, and it was decided to try and definitely
settle on the crew for the first boat. Then
the second choice could be made, and some practice
races arranged.</p>

<p>In order to be absolutely fair, Mr. Lighton
and Mr. Pierson shifted about those who had
been rowing together. I mean Tom and the
seven lads with whom he was more closely associated
than with any others&mdash;Sid, Phil, Bricktop
Molloy, Frank, Holly Cross, Dutch, and
Kindlings. Jerry was kept as coxswain in the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
boat, but Tom, Phil, Holly and Dutch were sent
out in the old one, with Bean Perkins for steersman,
while four lads who had not been given much
practice were imported into the new shell with
Frank, Sid, Kindlings and Bricktop Molloy.</p>

<p>“Now, boys, see what you can do!” urged the
coach.</p>

<p>It was the first time the new shell had been
tried, and it was found fully up to expectations.
But it was a little differently made from the old
one, and this made the lads a bit awkward in it.
However, they rowed fairly well, though in a short
trial race the old shell came out ahead.</p>

<p>“We’ll do some more shifting,” decided Mr.
Lighton, and he and Mr. Pierson tried different
combinations, but still separating the eight lads
who had rowed together from the start.</p>

<p>This was kept up for some days, the lads all,
meanwhile, being on training. But when a week
had passed, and the old and new boats had see-sawed
back and forth, first one winning and then
the other, Mr. Lighton shook his head in doubt.</p>

<p>“Something is wrong,” he said. “We’ll never
be able to pick a varsity crew of either of them.
We need a consistent winner.”</p>

<p>“That is right,” agreed Mr. Pierson. “Why
not try the same eight you had at first&mdash;the four
lads whom I coached this Summer, and their four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
intimate friends? I fancy they would do better
together in the new boat.”</p>

<p>“We’ll try it,” assented the coach.</p>

<p>The result was an improvement at once. Even
with the awkwardness of the new shell as a handicap,
Tom and his seven friends at once opened
water between their craft and the other one. And
it was not surprising when you consider that they
had had considerable practice together, and had
played baseball and football through several college
seasons.</p>

<p>“I think that’s the varsity crew all right,” declared
Mr. Pierson, after watching the test.</p>

<p>“I agree with you&mdash;unless something unforeseen
occurs,” said Mr. Lighton. “Now we must give
some attention to the others in the fours, singles
and doubles.”</p>

<p>Practice in these craft had been going steadily
on, and in time the crews that were to try to make
Randall the champion were picked, subject, of
course, to change, a number of substitutes being
arranged for.</p>

<p>Word came that the Boxer Hall and Fairview
varsity crews in the different shells were doing
hard work. They had the advantage of not having
to pick new and somewhat green crews. But
the spirit of Randall was not affected by this.</p>

<p>“Now, boys!” exclaimed Mr. Lighton one
afternoon, when the two eights had gone out for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
a practice race. “I want you to do your best.
Row hard! Try to imagine you’re in a race.
Row hard, everybody!”</p>

<p>“There may be a race if those fellows will consent
to a brush with us,” said Bricktop to Frank,
as he looked down the river and saw the Boxer
Hall eight approaching. “I wonder if we can
chance it&mdash;to see which of our boats would win.”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” assented Frank.</p>

<p>“Silence in the boat!” cried Coxswain Jackson.
“Save your breath to row with!”</p>

<p>“Sure he’s getting to be a regular fussing martinet!”
declared Bricktop, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Silence in the boat!” commanded Jerry again,
and he meant it. Meanwhile the Boxer Hall eight
came sweeping on. Would she give Randall an
impromptu race?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</a><br />
<small>A BRUSH WITH BOXER</small></h2>


<p>“What do you think about it, boys?” called
Mr. Lighton, from the launch where he and Mr.
Pierson were sitting to do the coaching as they
glided along. “Do you want to try it?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing!” answered Tom.</p>

<p>“Of course,” assented Pete Backus, from the
second eight.</p>

<p>“All right. Just row along then, and don’t
make any allusion to a race,” advised Mr. Lighton.
“If they want to pick up and come in, let
them. Only&mdash;don’t let them win!” he added,
significantly. “Even if it is only a friendly brush.”</p>

<p>“Let them win! I should say not!” declared
Frank. “Be ready to pick me up quick now, fellows,
when Jerry gives the word to spurt.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” echoed Bricktop Molloy, from
his position behind the stroke oar.</p>

<p>“And say, we don’t want to let those fellows
do us, either,” went on Percy Pineford, coxswain
of the second eight. “Let’s beat the varsity and
Boxer Hall, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>“If we can,” remarked Harry Chapin, who was
at stroke.</p>

<p>“We can if you’ll pull hard enough and fast
enough,” retorted the coxswain.</p>

<p>“Naturally. That’s as easy as <i>pons asinorum</i>
to say, but not so easy to do,” commented number
six&mdash;Billie Burden.</p>

<p>“Say, if you lads want to have any breath left
for rowing you’d better stop talking,” commented
the coach, and after that there was silence in the
varsity as well as in the second eight.</p>

<p>On came Boxer Hall, and not a Randall lad
but envied their long, powerful stroke, so evenly
done, and with such seeming power back of it. But
Boxer Hall had been turning out winning crews
for several years, and they had had much practice.</p>

<p>But, with all that, as Mr. Lighton and Mr.
Pierson watched the two crews of Randall, out of
whose numbers they hoped would come a varsity
winner, the head coach remarked:</p>

<p>“Our boys do very well.”</p>

<p>“Very well indeed,” responded the Cornell
man. “In fact I like their stroke better than
that of Boxer Hall’s. It is likely to last longer,
and is not so tiring. Our boys feather better,
too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks to your instruction this Summer
to Tom Parsons and his three chums. Four good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
rowers in a boat help to put it in the champion
class.”</p>

<p>If it was the intention of Boxer Hall to indulge
in a race with our friends the river champions
gave no intention of it at this time. They rowed
on slowly, being some distance down the stream.
The water was wide at this point, and there was
room for several craft abreast, even with the long
oars in the outriggers which set well out over the
gunwales.</p>

<p>“Watch out for a sudden spurt,” advised
Frank, in a low voice to Jerry, who nodded in his
coxswain’s seat, and got the tiller ropes in a firm
grasp.</p>

<p>Boxer Hall was known to be foxy, and if she
could creep up on her rival, and, by a sudden increase
in the stroke, gain such an advantage that
Randall would find it hard to overcome the lead
obtained, it would look as though our friends were
outclassed. But there were wise boys at Randall,
too.</p>

<p>The two Randall eights&mdash;the old and the new&mdash;had
separated to allow Boxer Hall to come between
them, if it was her desire to have a friendly
brush. At first it seemed as though Boxer would
decline, but, at the last moment, the course of the
boat was changed, and she shot straight for the
open water between the other two craft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now for it!” murmured Jerry in a low voice.
“Be ready, fellows!”</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken when, at a shout from
their coxswain, the Boxer rowers suddenly increased
their stroke. They had waited until almost
on even terms with the other two boats, and
evidently hoped to catch our friends unawares.</p>

<p>But they reckoned without their host, for Jerry
and his fellow coxswain gave the order to increase,
and the sixteen lads responded nobly.</p>

<p>Only for an instant did Boxer Hall hold her
advantage. She did shoot ahead, but in a moment
her two rivals were on even terms with her, and
there they hung for more than a minute.</p>

<p>“Well, it didn’t work&mdash;did it?” called Jerry
over to Pinky Davenport, who had succeeded
Dave Ogden as coxswain of the Boxer eight.</p>

<p>“What didn’t work?” asked Pinky, innocently.</p>

<p>“Oh, you didn’t jump us,” and Jerry laughed,
for he saw by the confused look on his rival’s face,
as well as on the countenances of the others that
their little trick&mdash;fair enough in its way&mdash;had
been discovered.</p>

<p>But if Randall hoped to have matters all her
own way, or even remain on even terms, she was
much mistaken. For a time the impromptu brush
had all the appearances of a real race, and the
three boats seemingly tried as hard to win as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
though the championship of the river depended
on it.</p>

<p>Then the second eight began falling behind.
The lads made a gallant effort to keep up, but the
grind was too much for them.</p>

<p>“It’s up to us now!” declared Jerry, in a low
voice. “I’m going to push you fellows!” and he
set the stroke at a heart-breaking pace.</p>

<p>His lads stood the “gaff” for a while, and
then, noting the distress on the faces of several,
Jerry, much against his will, had to lower the
rapidity of the stroke.</p>

<p>Boxer Hall had held pace with her rival, giving
them stroke for stroke, and now as Pinky saw
his opponents in distress, he called for a quick
spurt. And to the credit of Boxer Hall, be it said
that her men responded in excellent style. They
kept up the pace until, in a swirl of water, they
had passed the varsity Randall eight, leaving that
and the second craft behind. And then, to show
that they had their nerve with them, the Boxer Hall
rowers did not let up for another minute, sending
their craft on at racing speed, even after they had
won, and Randall was resting on her oars, completely
“tuckered out.”</p>

<p>It was a bad beating for Randall, and the faces
of the two coaches as they came up in their launch
showed the disappointment they felt.</p>

<p>“Pretty punk; wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Regular ice wagon as far as we were concerned.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think they had that spurt in ’em.”</p>

<p>“And yet we seemed to be rowing pretty well.
I guess it takes more than one season to make a
winning eight.”</p>

<p>Silence followed these discouraging observations
on the part of the four inseparables as they
sat in their room the evening following the beating
of the first and second shells by the Boxer Hall
crew. There had been a meeting of the coaches
with the Randall rowers immediately after coming
off the water, and several plans had been talked
over, involving a shifting of the crews. But in the
end it was decided to wait another day or so.</p>

<p>There was no disputing the fact that Randall
had expected at least the varsity boat to keep up
to, if not beat, their rival. And they had failed.
It was a bitter pill to swallow, with the time of the
regatta so close at hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“It sure was rotten,” said Tom musingly, as
he sat staring vacantly at nothing. No one took
the trouble to comment on his last remark. They
had about exhausted their stock of bitter reflections
and observations.</p>

<p>“Something’s got to be done,” went on Tom.
Still no one answered him. The fussy little alarm
clock ticked on, as though trying to be cheerful in
the midst of all that gloom. It was as though it
said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Cheer&mdash;up&mdash;I’m&mdash;here&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You’ll&mdash;win&mdash;next&mdash;year!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“I wonder what we can do?” Tom mused on.</p>

<p>Sid shifted uneasily in one of the easy chairs.
Phil duplicated in the other. Frank turned to a
more comfortable position on the old sofa, thereby
bringing forth creaks, groans and vibrations
of protest from the ancient piece. Tom was trying
to get used to an old steamer chair, that had
been picked up, with other relics, at an auction
held by a retiring senior the previous June, but
as the chair had lost one leg, which had been replaced
by part of a Turkish rocker, and as the
foot-rest had, in some former day, been broken
off and put back upside down, Tom’s effort to be
at ease was more or less of a failure.</p>

<p>“Something has got to be done!” went on the
pitcher. Once more the silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, for the love of tripe!” Tom finally burst
out. “Have none of you any tongues?”</p>

<p>He sat up so suddenly that the steamer chair,
probably rotted by too much salt air on many
voyages, collapsed, letting him down with a bump,
and raising a cloud of dust from the old rug.</p>

<p>“Good!” cried Phil.</p>

<p>“See if you can do it again,” urged Sid. “Frank
had his head turned, and didn’t see it all.”</p>

<p>“Yes, do,” begged the Big Californian, chuckling.</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted Tom. “I thought I’d make
you find your tongues somehow&mdash;you bunch of
mourners!” and he limped across the room, to
lean against the mantle, surveying the wreck of
the chair.</p>

<p>“Hurt yourself much?” asked Phil, solicitously.</p>

<p>“A heap you fellows’d care,” was the retort.</p>

<p>“Think you can row?” Sid wanted to know.</p>

<p>“What’s the good of rowing if Boxer walks
away from us like that?” demanded Tom, fiercely.
“That’s what I’ve been putting up to you fellows
all evening, and you never opened your mouths.
We’re going to lose, I can see that. What’s the
good of trying?”</p>

<p>He was so bitter&mdash;it was so unlike Tom’s usually
cheery self&mdash;that his chums looked at one
another in some alarm. As the pitcher went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the bathroom to get some arnica for a slight bruise
that had resulted from the chair’s collapse, Sid
murmured:</p>

<p>“I guess Boswell has gotten on his nerves.”</p>

<p>“How Boswell?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Ruth,” Sid further enlightened him.</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it,” broke in Phil. “Sis
wouldn’t have anything to do with Bossy, while
Tom was around.”</p>

<p>“Talking about me?” suspiciously demanded
the tall pitcher, entering the room at that moment.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing serious,” replied Phil, coolly.
“We were just wondering what gave you the
grouch.”</p>

<p>“Grouch! Wouldn’t anyone have a grouch if
he’d practiced in the shell all Summer, and rowed
his heart out, only to be beaten by Boxer&mdash;and not
in a regular race, either? Wouldn’t he?”</p>

<p>“You’re no worse off than the rest of us,” declared
Frank, sharply. “We feel it just as badly
as you do, Tom.”</p>

<p>“You don’t act so. You’ve been sitting here
as mum as oysters!” came the bitter retort. It
was the nearest in a long time Tom had come to
a breach with his chums.</p>

<p>“What was the good of talking?” asked Sid.
“Talking and shooting off a lot of hot air isn’t
going to make the varsity eight the head of the
river; is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, but you might find some way of doing it
if you said something, instead of acting like
Sphinxes,” snapped Tom.</p>

<p>“I wonder if that chair can be fixed?” broke in
Phil, anxious to turn the subject, for matters were
being strained to the breaking point. “You sure
did come down with an awful crash, Tom. Poor
old chair! I’m glad it wasn’t one of our good
ones.”</p>

<p>“Good ones!” cried Tom, who had bid in the
steamer affair at the auction, much against the
wishes of his chums. “Say, this has those other
ancient arks beaten a mile,” and stooping over he
began trying to solve the twisted puzzle of the
arms, legs and foot-rest that seemed to have gotten
into an inextricable tangle.</p>

<p>“Oh, I give it up!” he cried, after several unsuccessful
efforts. “We’ll let one of the janitors
play doctor,” and he laughed.</p>

<p>“That sounds better!” exclaimed Phil.</p>

<p>“It would sound better if we had won to-day,”
went on Tom. “Why in the name of the binomial
theorem couldn’t we?”</p>

<p>“The answer is easy,” spoke Frank. “They’ve
had more practice than we have, they pull better,
they have more power; three things that they excel
us in. What’s the result? Power, practice and
skill added together equal a win.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>“But isn’t there any way we can get those three
things?” demanded Tom fretfully.</p>

<p>“Next year, maybe,” assented Phil.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get ’em this year!” cried Tom,
smiting his open palm with his clenched fist. “I
won’t admit we can’t get ’em. We’ve got to beat
Boxer Hall and Fairview, and we’ve got to get
in condition in the next two weeks! Do you fellows
hear? We’ve got to double up on our work!
We&mdash;we&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Hear! Hear!” broke in the voice of Bricktop
Molloy, as he entered the room at that moment.
“What’s all the row about? Tommy, me
lad, you’re getting to be a regular orator, so ye
are!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</a><br />
<small>THE REGATTA</small></h2>


<p>“Come on in, Bricktop, and help us settle the
row,” invited Sid.</p>

<p>“Row! I should say so!” cried the red-haired
lad. “Who’s been breakin’ up th’ furniture?”
and he dropped into his broadest brogue.</p>

<p>“Tom here,” laughed Frank. “He isn’t satisfied
with the way the eight rowed to-day.”</p>

<p>“Faith! an’ I guess none of us are,” replied
Bricktop. And then the five students fell to discussing
the matter from all viewpoints. Presently
Holly Cross dropped in, and then Kindlings, so
with nearly the whole varsity crew present the
room was well filled.</p>

<p>There were opinions <em>pro</em> and <em>con</em>, there were
periods of doubt, to be succeeded by others of
some hope. And the result of it all was that they
decided they had underestimated Boxer Hall’s
prowess, and would have to “perk-up” and do
more and harder practice in the time that was left.</p>

<p>Communicating this decision to Mr. Lighton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the next morning, the lads found that he agreed
with them.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pierson and I have talked it over,” he
said, “and we have come to the conclusion that
to make a shift in the varsity eight now would be
fatal. We must stand or fall by what we have.
It is too late now. And, mind you, I am not so
sure that even if there was more time that I would
make a shift. I’m certain, in my own mind, that
we have a championship boat. Now it’s up to you
lads to confirm my belief in you.”</p>

<p>“And we will!” cried Tom, a sentiment that
was echoed by his chums.</p>

<p>Then began at Randall a period of hard and
exacting practice, such as had never been known
before. The two coaches were fairly overworked,
for by this time the first of the football squads
was beginning to form. Many of the rowing
lads were to play on the gridiron, but they were
cautioned only to do light practice until after the
regatta, as it would not do to have them overtrained.</p>

<p>The weather was exceptionally warm that September,
just right for rowing and a little too close
for heavy football work, so in one way Randall
had an advantage as regards her crews. It was
an advantage, though, shared by her rivals, for
both Boxer Hall and Fairview had made up their
separate minds to be champion of the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>Boxer Hall, to be sure, now held this title,
having defeated Fairview in the annual water
sports in the Spring. But now with the new triple
league formed, the title of “champion” was more
or less uncertain. Not until this Fall regatta
could it be definitely settled.</p>

<p>It had been decided to follow the same rules
and customs as obtained between Boxer and Fairview.
That is, there were to be a certain number
of races&mdash;singles, doubles, the four, and the eight-oared
shells, and the count was to be as follows:</p>

<p>A total of twenty points was decided on. Winning
the eight-oared contest would count ten, the
single shells would add two points, the double
would count as three and the four would secure
five. So that it can easily be seen that the winning
of the eight-oared race meant much. Of course if
one college should come out ahead in the singles,
doubles and four-oared races she would have ten
points, and should another win the eight, the score
would be tied. But the possibility of this was remote.</p>

<p>In addition there was to be a tub race, which
would not count in the championship, but for which
several prizes were offered.</p>

<p>But if Randall worked hard, so did her rivals.
From the other two colleges came news of cross-country
runs for the improvement of the wind of
the rowers. The training was reduced to a more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
scientific basis. It was even rumored that Boxer
Hall had imported a well-known physical instructor
to assist the coach. And Fairview had summoned
a number of old graduates, who had made
their marks while at college, to assist in turning
out a championship crew or crews.</p>

<p>Though the other races were regarded as important,
most of the interest centered in the eight.
Little was heard but about this shell, which in a
way, perhaps, was unfair to the other rowers, who
were practicing faithfully.</p>

<p>Much was heard about the advantage Boxer
Hall and Fairview possessed, in that they had been
rowing on the river for years. In a measure this
was true, and Randall was under somewhat of a
handicap in this respect.</p>

<p>Yet, in another way, it was a good thing, for
Randall came into the game fresh, without any
preconceived notions, and her boys had learned
what they knew from the ground up. They were
not hampered by college traditions as regards a
certain stroke, and Mr. Lighton and Mr. Pierson
had developed a logical one&mdash;differing somewhat
from either Boxer Hall’s or Fairview’s&mdash;a combination
of the two, modeled after the famous
Cornell stroke.</p>

<p>And how Tom and his chums did work, train
and practice! Lessons suffered in a way, but the
lads were well enough along in college now to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
know that they could make them up that Winter.
And Dr. Churchill, bless his big heart! Dr.
Churchill was not too inquiring. On one occasion
Prof. Emerson Tines went to the head of the
school to complain that he would have to condition
a number of his Latin pupils unless their work
showed improvement.</p>

<p>“And most of them, my dear Dr. Churchill,”
he said, “are of the boating class. A lot of foolishness&mdash;a
mere waste of time. It was bad enough
with baseball and football, but now that rowing
has started, it is worse than ever. I wish those
old graduates had never made their gift!”</p>

<p>“Tut! Tut! My dear Professor!” remonstrated
Dr. Churchill. “Rowing is a form of exercise
that develops muscles never brought to the
owner’s attention in any other way. I have been
reading up on the subject since the eleven has
taken to the shell, and I find that the ancient
Romans, in their galleys, had rowing down to a
perfection rarely attained to-day. It is an ancient
and honest sport, and I’m sure I hope our nine
will win the regatta,” and then, good old soul,
unaware that he had mixed the football and baseball
squads most woefully with the crew, turned to
his work on his dictionary, which to-be-famous
work had progressed as far as the Cha. to Dem.
volume, and bade fair to be completed in about
fifty years, but Dr. Churchill did not think of that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>The chums were all tired enough this night to
sleep, as Sid put it, without being rocked. They
had retired early, for there was to be sharp practice
the next day.</p>

<p>Lessons had been gone over, with as much attention
as it was possible to concentrate on them,
considering all that was going on, the alarm clock
had been relieved of the “toothpick in its appendix,”
as Tom remarked, and it was cheerfully
ticking away.</p>

<p>“Queer about that time the clock disappeared,
when someone came in our room, and you took
him for me; isn’t it, Tom?” asked Sid, as he got
his shaving apparatus in shape for quick use the
next morning.</p>

<p>“It sure is. We’ve never had another visit
from the unknown.”</p>

<p>“And I hope we don’t,” put in Phil.</p>

<p>“Say, did you hear the latest?” asked Frank,
as he untied the string of his shoe.</p>

<p>“No, is there going to be another shift in the
varsity boat?” asked Phil.</p>

<p>“No, but a lot of the fellows have been missing
little things from their rooms; scarf pins and the
like. And the funny part of it is that it’s all on the
next floor of our dormitory. A regular epidemic,
one of the fellows was telling me.”</p>

<p>“Have we a kleptomaniac among us?” demanded
Sid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe it’s one of the new janitors,” suggested
Tom. “There’s one that has a bad eye.”</p>

<p>“Well, as long as they stay off this floor, we’ll
be all right,” asserted Sid. “Only we’d better keep
our valuables locked up.”</p>

<p>“Anyhow, they can’t take the old chairs and
sofa,” remarked Frank with a chuckle. “They’re
too heavy.”</p>

<p>It seemed to be Tom’s fate to see the end of the
little happening, as it had been his to note the beginning.
Late that night he was awakened by a
noise in the main apartment. At first he paid no
attention to it, and then, as he heard the rustle of
papers, he thought of the time he had followed, as
he thought, Sid, in the dark, cold corridors.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” he exclaimed to himself, as he sat
up without making the bed creak. “He’s at it
again! And this time I’m going to find out who it
is!”</p>

<p>Softly he crept to the door of his room. He
saw the same white-clad figure as before, standing
near the window. This time he knew it was not
Sid, although the two looked much alike. The only
sound was the ticking of the alarm clock.</p>

<p>Then, as Tom watched, the figure approached
the table once more. The change in the tone of
the ticking of the clock told Tom what had happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s got our clock!” thought Tom. “Here
is where I catch him red-handed, so to speak.”</p>

<p>The figure glided from the door into the hallway,
and Tom followed, pausing but a moment to
make sure that his three chums were in their beds.
From their opened doors the sounds of three different
styles of breathing assured him of this.
Then he glided on.</p>

<p>Once more he followed the white-robed figure
until it ascended the stairs to the story above, but
this time Tom was close behind when the door
opened.</p>

<p>“Hold on there!” exclaimed Tom, as the portal
was about to close, and reaching forward he
laid his hand on the shoulder of a student. “I’ll
trouble you for our clock!” said Tom, sternly.</p>

<p>Then he got one of the surprises of his life.
With a startled cry the lad he had grabbed turned
about, and his widely opened eyes suddenly
changed their expression&mdash;changed so queerly that
Tom knew he had the solution of the mystery.</p>

<p>“A sleep-walker!” he gasped, as he recognized
Harry Johnson, one of the Juniors who did not
enter much into the sporting life of Randall.
“He’s been doing this in his sleep!”</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what is it&mdash;where&mdash;have I? Oh, I’ve
been at it again!” gasped the lad as he was
aroused. “I beg your pardon, Parsons. Hope I
haven’t done anything very bad this time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing but our clock, old man. Are you in
the habit of doing this?”</p>

<p>“Not often, though the spell does come on me
once in a while. It’s a relic of my childhood days.
And so I went to your room and took your
clock?”</p>

<p>“Yes. This is the second time. Do you recall
the first?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least. And yet I must have done
so if you saw me. Probably some night later I
went down in the cellar with it and put it on the
furnace. Say, I’m mighty sorry.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. Better lock your door after
this.”</p>

<p>“I will. Come in, and tell me what a fool I
made of myself.”</p>

<p>Tom, who had on a warm bath robe this time,
consented, and in a whisper related the details of
the first occurrence. Johnson was contrite, and admitted
that it must have been he who had taken
the clock, though in his waking hours he recalled
nothing of it.</p>

<p>“It must have been the tick that attracted me,”
he explained. “Well, I guess I’d better take some
treatment. Have a glass of ginger ale?”</p>

<p>“Don’t care if I do, though it’s breaking training.”</p>

<p>As Johnson got a bottle from a closet he uttered
an exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look here!” he called to Tom. “Where did
these things come from?” and in the bottom of a
little case, where the bottles had been, he pointed
to a collection of things.</p>

<p>“By Jove!” cried Tom. “I’ve solved the other
mystery! You’ve been taking this stuff in your
sleep!”</p>

<p>And so poor Johnson had. There was found
all the articles missing from the rooms of various
students. Johnson had, in his sleep, entered and
taken them, concealing them in a closet, and, in
his waking hours, forgetting about them. They
were returned the next morning, with suitable apologies,
and the matter was quietly dropped, for
the students all understood how it could have happened.
Johnson consulted a doctor, and was soon
cured of his propensity to night wanderings.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad I solved the mystery, since I
started it,” remarked Tom the next morning.</p>

<p>Day after day passed, and the crews of the
eights, as well as the other rowers, fairly lived on
the river. The weather was remarkably fine,
which was in their favor. Day after day the practice
and training were kept up, and the coaches
were faithful. A number of the old graduates
who had been instrumental in providing the gift,
came to Randall, and offered suggestions, some of
which, being valuable, were adopted.</p>

<p>And then the natural result followed all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
hard work. The time of the eight, especially, began
to improve. The boys rowed with more snap
and vigor. They could stand the “gaff” better,
and when Jerry Jackson, sitting crouched up in his
coxswain’s seat, called for a spurt, there were not
so many “bellows to mend” in the shape of panting
lads, as there had been.</p>

<p>“We’re coming on!” cried Mr. Lighton proudly,
at the close of an exciting brush between the
first and second boats one day, when the varsity
had won. “We’re coming on!”</p>

<p>“If we can only keep it up,” breathed Frank,
who, being captain of the eight, as well as stroke,
felt his responsibility.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll do it, old man,” declared Tom, and
he succeeded in infusing some of his spirit into
his chums. The faint hearts of the weeks before
had become strong.</p>

<p>“But you boys needn’t think you are going to
win!” declared Ruth, when the four lads called
on the four girls about a week prior to the date set
for the regatta. “We have a championship crew
in the eight, if nowhere else.”</p>

<p>“Never!” cried Tom. “We’re going to win
the eight if we lose everything else; eh, fellows?”</p>

<p>“That’s what!” his chums chorused.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, I’m glad of one thing,” remarked
Ruth, in a low voice to Tom, “Phil is so interested
in this rowing game that he hasn’t said a word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
about my lost brooch. The other day I had on
the new pin I bought to take its place, and he
stared at it without making a remark. But, oh,
Tom! I wonder if we’ll ever find it?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look so&mdash;not now,” replied Tom,
mournfully.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” she consoled him. “We did
our best.”</p>

<p>“And lost out by a narrow squeak,” thought
Tom to himself, recalling the pawn tickets and
other clues that had gone for naught. The police
had not been able to get a trace of either Mendez
or Blasdell, nor had the missing pawnbroker been
found.</p>

<p>Finally the great day came. The last practice
had been held, the lads, not only of Randall, but
at the rival colleges, were “trained to the minute.”
The coaches had made their last appeals.</p>

<p>“Well, fellows, to-morrow tells the tale,” said
Frank to his seven chums, on the night before
regatta-day. They had all met in the gymnasium
for a final conference with Mr. Lighton, and had
partaken of a light lunch.</p>

<p>“I’m as nervous as a cat,” declared Sid.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare be!” exclaimed the captain of
the eight. “But if you must be&mdash;be it now, and
steady up for to-morrow. Now off to bed, and
everybody sleep soundly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>And then regatta-day broke&mdash;calm, with a
bright sun overhead, a hint of Fall coolness in the
air that sent a little tingle through the blood&mdash;just
the day for the races.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</a><br />
<small>A CLOSE FINISH</small></h2>


<p>“Come on now, fellows, hit her up again! All
together and I want every man to sing! Ready
now!” and Bean Perkins, the official cheer-leader,
the “shouter” of Randall, signalled with his megaphone
to his cohorts who were lined up near the
boathouse, in and around which the various crews
or single-shell men were gathered. “Tear it out
now!” commanded Bean, and that glorious old
Latin song&mdash;“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aut Vincere, Aut Mori!</i>”&mdash;“Either
We Conquer or We Die!” welled out over the
river. It was the song that, time and again, had
urged Randall on to victory. Would it once
more?</p>

<p>“When are we going to start?” asked Tom, as
he walked back and forth on the float, clad in
rowing togs, as were a score of others, for a number
of substitutes had been provided.</p>

<p>“Don’t get nervous now, old man,” advised
Frank. “The shell will be in the water soon, and
then we’ll go down to the starting point. They’re
going to run off all the other races first, you know.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
We’re last. We’ve got more than hour yet. Better
get on a sweater and a blanket, you might be
chilly. You fellows do the same thing,” he commanded,
to his crew.</p>

<p>“I wish we were going in first&mdash;and get it over
with,” said Sid. “This waiting&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Say, cut it out!” cried Frank. “If you fellows
want to have a case of nerves go off by yourselves
somewhere. I want to watch the other
races.”</p>

<p>“I think our fellows have a good chance in the
four,” said Dan Woodhouse.</p>

<p>“We’ve got a good chance in everything&mdash;do
you hear that, me boy?” cried Bricktop, in his
rich brogue. “We’re going to win everything!
Just because you’re in the eight you mustn’t be
selfish.”</p>

<p>“I’m not, only&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Here comes our four!” interrupted Frank.
“A cheer for ’em, boys!” and the echoes vibrated
as the rallying cry went forth.</p>

<p>“Come on now, fellows,” cried Bean, dancing
about, the colors of Randall on his megaphone
fluttering in the wind. “All yell&mdash;</p>

<p>“That’s us&mdash;Randall!” and the song and cry
sent the members of the four-oared crew rejoicing
on their way. They were Joe Jackson&mdash;Jerry’s
twin brother&mdash;Bert Trendell, Pete Backus and Sam
Terry.</p>

<p>Early in the season Bean Perkins had been
picked for the four, but he had not made good.
Anyhow, he declared, he could help Randall more
with yelling than any other way, and many agreed
with him, for Bean was certainly a “shouter.”</p>

<p>The river presented a gay scene. It was fairly
covered with boats, until it seemed an impossibility
that a race could be held. But the course had been
marked off, and soon the boats of the officials
would patrol the water-pathway and clear it.</p>

<p>Owing to the different lengths of the various
races, several starting points had been selected,
and the races had been timed so that the crowds
could get from one to the other to watch the beginning
if they desired. Of course the eight-oared
race was the longest&mdash;three miles in this case,
since the course of the river, narrowing as it did
at several points, did not offer any longer course
at any place available to the colleges. And three
eight-oared shells take up considerable room
abreast.</p>

<p>Launches, rowboats, and a sailboat or two,
made up the craft holding the spectators. In addition
the banks of the river, for a mile or more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
were gay with those who had come to witness the
aquatic sports. The finish of all the races was to
be at the Randall boathouse. This had been decided
by lot, and our friends had been lucky. They
were glad, too, since they could offer the hospitality
of their new building to their rivals. And,
in a way, Fairview and Boxer were glad, as their
boathouses were rather ancient, and could accommodate
only a comparatively few guests, while
Randall’s was large and roomy.</p>

<p>Fairview and Boxer Hall had their crews or
individual rowers nearly all assembled. A few
were not yet on hand, and some of the shells had
not yet arrived. But all was in readiness for the
three-cornered four-oared shell contest.</p>

<p>“Say, who’s going to win?” challenged Tom of
Ruth, for the girls, as you may well suppose, had
been provided with choice places by our friends,
where they could see all the finishes well.</p>

<p>“Who’s going to win?” repeated Madge Tyler.
“Why, we are, of course! See our colors?” and
she flaunted them in Tom’s face.</p>

<p>He looked at Ruth, and beneath a bow of the
ribbon of the hues of Fairview, Tom caught a
glimpse of his own college colors&mdash;a tiny bow.
Ruth saw his glance, smiled and&mdash;blushed.</p>

<p>“You may win some, but the eight comes to
us!” declared Sid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, aren’t we the sure ones, though!” mocked
Helen Newton.</p>

<p>“Wait until it’s all over,” advised Mabel Harrison.</p>

<p>“They’re going to start!” suddenly cried
Madge, as the three four-oared shells moved off
down the stream.</p>

<p>“No, they’re only going to the starting point,”
said Frank. “This is only a mile race, and they
decided to row down to it instead of being towed,
so as to get a little warm-up practice. I thought
it would be a good thing for our crew to row down
to the start, but Mr. Lighton says he has provided
a launch for us, and the shell will be towed.”</p>

<p>“I wish it was all over,” murmured Tom.</p>

<p>“So do I,” agreed Ruth, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Come on now, boys! Another song!” demanded
Bean Perkins, and the strains welled
forth.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Boxer Hall!” came the demand,
and it was given with a will.</p>

<p>“Three big ones for Fairview!” called an adherent
of that co-educational institution.</p>

<p>The four-oared crews, selected after much elimination
work, were approaching their starting
point. They were out of sight of those at the
boathouse now, and it would be a little time before
they appeared, rowing to the finish line.</p>

<p>The band began to play. There was gay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
laughter and talk, and some nervous walking
about by those lads who were to race next. The
course had been cleared, though now and then
some craft would trespass on it, to be hustled out
of the way by the official boats.</p>

<p>It seemed an almost interminable time before
the shout sounded:</p>

<p>“Here they come!”</p>

<p>There was a craning forward by all. Many
who had fieldglasses used them. Ruth produced a
pair.</p>

<p>“Who’s leading?” begged Tom, in an agony
of doubt.</p>

<p>“Fairview!” she replied.</p>

<p>“No, really?” and he almost grabbed the binoculars
from her hands. “That’s right,” he admitted,
grimly. “But our boys are pulling strong.”</p>

<p>“If they can only win!” breathed Sid.</p>

<p>“Keep still!” commanded Phil, whose nerves,
as were those of his chums, were at a tension.</p>

<p>Cheers began to drift along the shore, coming
from the crowds lining the banks.</p>

<p>“Randall has pulled up!” cried Sid. “Our
boys are rowing strong!”</p>

<p>“They’ve got a ways to go to finish,” murmured
Tom. “Oh, if they can last it out!”</p>

<p>Randall had a good lead now, and it was seen
that Fairview was splashing badly. It developed
later that two of her four-oared crew were overtrained&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
could not stand the heart-breaking
strain at the finish.</p>

<p>“Come on, you Randall! Come on!” was the
cry.</p>

<p>“Boxer’s creeping up!”</p>

<p>“No, Randall’s taken a spurt!”</p>

<p>Conflicting were the cries. The boats were
see-sawing now. They were getting nearer and
nearer to the finish line. The crowds leaned forward.
Pandemonium broke loose. All three colleges
were being cheered.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a tie!” yelled Phil, as he
pointed to the Boxer and Randall shells, now almost
bow and bow. “A dead heat! Fairview is
out of it!”</p>

<p>“Come on, boys!” implored Tom, stretching
out his hands as though to pull their shell forward.</p>

<p>There came a momentary hush. Then a great
roar broke out.</p>

<p>“Boxer! Boxer Hall wins! Wow, look at
that spurt!”</p>

<p>And, with sinking hearts, our friends watched
their rival’s shell dart over the line, a winner by
a bare quarter of a length&mdash;but still a winner.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI</a><br />
<small>THE TUB RACE</small></h2>


<p>Randall’s adherents seemed stunned at first.
They had been so sure of winning when the two
fours swept up to the finish line, with Randall so
close to Boxer, that, when victory was snatched
from their very grasp, it seemed hard indeed. No
one knew what to do, while the victors rested on
their oars, justifiable smiles of triumph on their
faces.</p>

<p>As for the losers, they hung their heads dejectedly,
and that tears of mortification came into
their eyes is not to their shame.</p>

<p>Then Tom Parsons found himself, and cried
out:</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Boxer Hall! It was a good
win!”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” echoed Sid Henderson.</p>

<p>And the cheers were given, none the less hearty
because they came from the defeated side.</p>

<p>“Clear the course!” came the command from
the judges’ boat, and then came the formal announcement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
of Boxer winning. She had five points
to her credit now.</p>

<p>The Fairview lads, in the bitterness of their
hearts, for they realized that it was overtraining,
and, in a way, over-confidence that had made them
third, rowed up to the float, disembarked and
walked away in silence&mdash;at least there was silence
until Bean Perkins yelled:</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Fairview&mdash;she knows how
to take a licking the same as Randall!”</p>

<p>And at once the river echoed the cheers.</p>

<p>“Well, you did us that time, Boxer!” went on
Bean. “But our time will come&mdash;we’re going to
do you in the eight.”</p>

<p>“Not if we know it,” retorted Pinky Davenport.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry&mdash;for you, Tom,” breathed
Ruth, as the tall pitcher stood close beside her on
the balcony of the boathouse. “Does it bother
you much?”</p>

<p>“Well, of course I’d like to have seen our four
win,” he replied, “but it doesn’t bother me. It
only makes me mad. We’ll win that eight if we
have to break every oar.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do that, Tom, old man,” advised
Frank, who heard this last. “Breaking an oar
is worse than catching a crab. It will lose us the
race sure. Be moderate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s hard, after all the work we did,” complained
Sid.</p>

<p>“But look at it,” put in Phil. “We beat Fairview,
and that’s something for a green crew to do.”</p>

<p>“So we did!” exclaimed Sid, brightening up.</p>

<p>“Awfully sweet of you to remind us of it,”
said Madge, making a little bow.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;er&mdash;I didn’t mean it that way,” stammered
Sid. “I didn’t think.”</p>

<p>“We’ll forgive you,” spoke Mabel, gently.</p>

<p>The single races were to have come next, but at
the last moment it was discovered that one of the
outriggers on the shell to be used by the Boxer
Hall contestant was split, so a halt was called until
he could get out one of the spare Randall boats.
Then he was allowed a half hour to “get acquainted
with his craft,” this being generously allowed
by the other two colleges.</p>

<p>“The tub race! Have the tub race now!”
came the general cry, and as none of the other
competitors wished to fill in the vacant time, and
as the tub race would not count in points, it was
decided to advance that on the program.</p>

<p>Accordingly, a number of washtubs, of good
size, which had been provided, were brought forward.
There were to be two contestants from
each college, making six that would compete for
first and second prizes, in the shape of silver cups.</p>

<p>Snail Looper and Dutch Housenlager were to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
represent Randall, Dutch being the only regular
rower who dared to brave the laughter of the
crowd.</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I?” he demanded, when questioned.
“It’ll be fun, and it will keep me from
thinking of the big race. Besides, I think it will
be good exercise, and I’m heavy enough to weight
my tub down in the water, and that’s a point. It
won’t turn so easily.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t strain yourself, that’s all,” counseled
Mr. Lighton. “We don’t want any slip-up
in the eight-oared race just because you want some
fun.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure, I’ll be careful!” promised Dutch,
making a playful grab for Sid, who jumped back,
thereby nearly upsetting an elderly gentleman who
was sitting near the edge of the balcony to see the
sports.</p>

<p>“Careful! Careful!” he exclaimed testily.</p>

<p>“Look out what you’re doing, Dutch!” warned
Tom. “He’s one of the committee that gave us
this rowing outfit. He’ll get you down on his bad
books if you don’t look out.”</p>

<p>“Just my luck!” cried Dutch, ruefully.</p>

<p>“Tub racers this way!” cried the starter.
“Lively now!”</p>

<p>With but a single paddle to propel them on, the
six lads, amid much laughter, took their places in
the tubs. They were to paddle to a stake boat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
about half way across the river, turn there, and
come back.</p>

<p>Anyone who has seen a tub race knows how almost
impossible it is to prevent the craft from
whirling about. It doesn’t seem to want to advance
in a straight line. This was the case here,
and when the lads started off it was only to go
swirling madly about in concentric circles.</p>

<p>“Go the other way!” was shouted at them.</p>

<p>“Yes, reverse&mdash;you’ll get dizzy!”</p>

<p>“Waltz me around again, Dutchy!” called
Tom to Housenlager.</p>

<p>“You watch!” he shouted back. “I’m going
to win!”</p>

<p>And it did seem as though he had a good
chance. Whether it was his weight, or the way in
which he used the paddle, was not manifested, but
he certainly forged ahead.</p>

<p>He managed to turn the stake-boat first,
though Snail Looper was a close second. Boxer
Hall was out of it in this race, her two representatives
seemingly not able to do much. But the two
Fairview lads were pressing Dutch and Snail
closely.</p>

<p>“Here I come! Here I come!” cried Dutch,
as, amid increased laughter, the four lads neared
the finishing line close to the float. But he did
not see how near one of the Fairview lads was to
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#image04">Then one of the latter tubs collided with that of
Dutch.</a> He uttered a surprised exclamation, turned
to look, and his paddle slipped from his grasp.</p>

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_278">THEN ONE OF THE LATTER TUBS COLLIDED WITH THAT OF DUTCH.</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Come back here!” yelled he, making a grab
for it.</p>

<p>Alas for Dutch! He over-balanced himself, or
perhaps he was dizzy from the whirling. At any
rate overboard he went with a splash.</p>

<p>“There! I knew something would happen!”
cried Mr. Lighton, in vexed tones, as he saw the
accident, and he hurried down to see that Dutch
quickly changed to dry rowing togs, for the tub
racers had worn their light garments.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Snail Looper came steadily on, finishing
first, with a Fairview lad second.</p>

<p>“First win for Randall!” yelled a Boxer Hall
adherent. “You fellows had better stick to tubs!”</p>

<p>“Wait!” murmured Tom. “This may put
Dutch in just the right trim to pull the race of his
life.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII</a><br />
<small>BOSWELL’S CHANCE</small></h2>


<p>“How about you, Dutch?” asked Tom eagerly,
as he hurried up to his dripping chum, while others
followed. The lads in rowing costumes did not
hesitate to crowd close, while the other spectators,
and there were many on the float, rather held
back, for Dutch, in the exuberance of his mirth,
was shaking himself like a Newfoundland dog,
scattering drops all over.</p>

<p>“Fine and dandy!” was the answer of the big
lad. “I just needed a bath.”</p>

<p>“Look here!” exclaimed Mr. Lighton, somewhat
sternly, “you had better get a good rub-down,
and put on some dry togs. Have you any
dry ones here?”</p>

<p>“No, but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He can take mine, I guess I’m not going to
get a chance to row,” spoke Harry Morton, a
Freshman, and he smiled gamely in spite of the
disappointment he must have felt, for he had
practiced hard, as a substitute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Mr. Lighton, and he gave
Morton a look that meant much. “Hurry now,
Housenlager.”</p>

<p>“Did you see me tumble in?” demanded Dutch,
with a cheerful grin.</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Tom, somewhat sharply. “Quit
your fooling now. We’ll be in the race soon.”</p>

<p>As the lad whose outrigger had delayed the
race for single shells was not satisfied with the
boat provided for him, another was gotten out.
This further delayed matters, and it was decided
to run off the doubles in the meanwhile. The
singles would follow and then would come the
great eight-oared contest, on which so much depended.</p>

<p>“Now boys, go in and win!” pleaded Mr.
Lighton, to George Carter and Ben Blake, who
were to uphold the honor of Randall in the
doubles. “Remember about keeping on your course.
If you are in your own water you’re all right.
Once you get off the course, and there’s an accident,
you’ll have to abide by it. And pull hard! Save
your breath for the spurt that is sure to come.
And look out for Boxer. They’re straining every
nerve to beat us in every event to-day. They want
to prove that it isn’t possible to make rowers in a
single season, and I want you to prove that it can
be done. It’s up to me&mdash;in a way&mdash;but I want you
to do your share. Will you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“We sure will!” cried Blake. “Eh, Carter?”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know,” assented the other.</p>

<p>“Remember, Blake, you’re the bowman,” went
on the coach. “Mind your steering. That new
mechanical contrivance on this boat works very
well. It’s delicate, though. The least touch of
your foot will shift the rudder. And give your
orders so Carter can hear you, but don’t waste too
much breath doing it.”</p>

<p>“Carter, mind your stroke. You may offset the
change of the rudder if you pull too hard or too
easy. Now go ahead&mdash;and may the Fates be kind
to you. Randall needs those three points.”</p>

<p>The three pair-oar boats moved off to the starting
point and the crowd prepared to watch another
exciting contest. Dutch had gone into the dressing
rooms, accompanied by one of the trainers, who
was directed to give him a rub-down. Tom followed,
and as he went in he passed Boswell, who
was also headed in the same direction.</p>

<p>“I guess they don’t ever intend the singles to be
rowed,” remarked the rich lad, with some disgust
in his tones. “Here I’ve been fiddling around just
because that chump from Boxer Hall can’t get a
shell to suit him. Why didn’t they look over their
outriggers before they came?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ll be ready soon,” spoke Tom. Boswell
had, as you may have assumed, been picked
to uphold the Randall end in the singles. To do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
him justice he had trained hard and well, and had
been faithful. He was not a favorite, chiefly because
he boasted so much, and talked so incessantly
of his “private trainer,” and other “possessions.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to get a handkerchief for my neck,”
explained Boswell, as he approached his locker.
“The sun’s hotter on the back of my neck than I
thought it was.”</p>

<p>Tom passed on, paying no more attention to the
single sculler. The tall pitcher was chiefly concerned
to see that Dutch did no more “cutting up,”
and dropped the horseplay with which he was wont
to amuse himself at all times.</p>

<p>“His monkey business may cost us the race,”
thought Tom, a bit angrily.</p>

<p>But Housenlager managed to contain himself,
and was soon in dry rowing togs again. He and
Tom lingered in the dressing rooms of the boathouse
until someone called for the loser of the tub
races to come out. Tom followed slowly, and, as
he did so, he passed Boswell, who was restoring
some of his garments to the locker, having tied a
silk handkerchief about his neck. It was the same
gaudy-hued one that had a strip torn from it, and,
at the sight, Tom’s memory went back to the hut
on Crest Island, to Ruth’s lost brooch, and to the
robbery.</p>

<p>“Well, I hope we get off soon,” remarked the
rich lad. He was stuffing something into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
pocket of his trousers. The garments fell from a
hook, and dropped to the floor. As they did so
something fell from them and rolled over, stopping
at Tom’s feet. He stooped to pick it up, and
to his surprise he saw that it was a gold brooch.
His wonder grew as he noticed that it was exactly
like the one Ruth had described to him as missing,
and similar in pattern to the one he had often seen
her wear&mdash;an old-fashioned pin, heavy and massive
in design.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” began Boswell, holding out his hand
for it.</p>

<p>Tom held it back. He glared at Boswell.</p>

<p>“Where&mdash;where did you get that?” exclaimed
Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know that it’s any of your affair,”
was the rather cool reply.</p>

<p>“Well, I intend to make it mine! Do you know
to whom that pin belongs?”</p>

<p>“Yes, to me, and I’ll trouble you to hand it
over.”</p>

<p>“Wait!” exclaimed Tom. “Wait, Boswell.
That pin isn’t yours, and you know it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I like your nerve! Whose is it?”</p>

<p>“Ruth Clinton’s!” blurted out Tom.</p>

<p>“Ruth Clinton’s?” cried Boswell. “She never
saw that pin. I&mdash;I intended giv&mdash;look here, Parsons,
what business of yours is this, anyhow? I
know you and Miss Clinton are&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>“You let her name alone!” cried Tom, fiercely.
“As for her never seeing this pin before&mdash;look
here!”</p>

<p>He pressed on the secret spring in the back&mdash;a
trick Ruth had taught him. A tiny panel of gold
flew open, disclosing the girl’s photograph beneath
it.</p>

<p>“There!” cried Tom. “I suppose that got
there by magic. Ruth never saw it; eh, Boswell?
I don’t know what to think of this&mdash;of you. You
must have heard about the jewel robbery&mdash;of the
missing Boxer Hall cups. And now you have this
pin&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Stop!” cried Boswell. “If you dare, Parsons,
say that I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ready for the singles! Boswell, are you
there?” called a voice at the door of the dressing
room. “Hurry out&mdash;Boxer wins the doubles!”</p>

<p>The two lads, almost ready to come to blows,
started. This was news indeed.</p>

<p>“Randall loses in the doubles!” cried Tom,
aghast.</p>

<p>“Yes,” went on Joe Jackson, who had come to
call Boswell. “Carter broke an oar near the finish
line, and it was all up then. It’s tough luck,
for our boat was leading.”</p>

<p>“Fate seems to be against us!” thought Tom,
bitterly. Boswell was staring at him and at the
gold brooch, which he still held.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look here!” blurted out Tom. “I know more
than you think I do. I saw you and Mendez in
the boat one day. You had a gold brooch then&mdash;you
were talking about old-fashioned jewelry.”</p>

<p>“Wait&mdash;stop!” burst out Boswell. “I’ll talk
to you about this. I’ll tell you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Boswell, they’re waiting for you!” interrupted
Joe. “The race is called. For the love of tripe
win it! Randall sure is in the soup to-day. Win!”</p>

<p>“I will!” cried the rich lad. “I can’t stop
now!” he cried to Tom, as he hurried out. “You
keep that pin. I’ll explain later. The man I got
it from may be around here yet!”</p>

<p>“You’d better guess I’ll keep this pin!” murmured
Tom. “As for an explanation, you’ll have
some tall talking to do to convince me. I begin
to see how things are now!”</p>

<p>Boswell ran out. There was a cheer from the
float&mdash;from the crowds along the river bank.</p>

<p>“Come on, Tom!” cried Joe. “You and your
crew are next. Oh, for the love of Randall win
that race! Boxer Hall has eight points now&mdash;the
four and the double. But if we win the eight and
the single we’ll have twelve, and be the champions.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll win!” cried Tom, desperately, as
he clasped Ruth’s brooch in his hand and raced
out. As he came from the dressing rooms he heard
Bean Perkins yelling:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>“All together now, boys! The ‘Conquer or
Die’ song, and sing it as if you meant it. Randall
is nearing the finish!”</p>

<p>Blake and Carter, bitter over the unforeseen
accident that had robbed them of victory, were getting
out of their shell. Boswell and the others, in
the singles were being sent off after brief instructions.
Tom looked at his rival, and many thoughts
came to him.</p>

<p>The crowd was now so dense on the float, and
on the stairway leading to the balcony, that Tom
could not make his way up to tell Ruth the good
news&mdash;that he had her brooch. He made the effort,
but it was next to impossible.</p>

<p>“Come on, Tom!” called Frank, behind him.
“Mr. Lighton wants the crew of the eight in the
dressing room for a last conference. Oh, cats!
But the time is getting close.”</p>

<p>“Don’t get nervous, you chump!” exclaimed
Dutch. “Look at Kindlings, as cool as an icehouse.”</p>

<p>Elation, worry, wonder and apprehension were
Tom’s mingled feelings as he followed his chums
and the coach. What Mr. Lighton said he hardly
comprehended. But the coach impressed on the
lads the necessity for coolness, the need of a spurt
at the right time, and then the keeping up of the
stroke until the bow of the boat had crossed the
finish line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Boswell, rowing with the others to the start,
was almost upset in his mind as was Tom.</p>

<p>“So, he thinks I stole that pin&mdash;all the jewelry,
I expect!” he mused. “What can I do? What
shall I do? I wonder where in the world Mendez
is? If I could only find him&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mind where you’re going, Randall!” called a
sharp voice, and Boswell changed his course, that
had threatened to cut into the Fairview shell.</p>

<p>Boswell and the others reached the starting line.
There they got into position, the last word was
given, there was a moment of suspense, and the
warning gun was fired. Then came the final signal,
and they were off.</p>

<p>Three backs bent to the stroke, six oars took
the water, there was a swirl of foam and bubbles.
Tiny whirlpools formed at the ends of the spoons,
and the single race was under way.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I can only win&mdash;if I can only win!”
thought Boswell.</p>

<p>And the lads from Boxer Hall and Fairview
thought the same thing.</p>

<p>It was half way to the finishing mark. Boswell
was rowing well, and was maintaining the slight
lead he had. Casting a glance over his shoulder
to note his course, his eyes swept the crowd on the
river bank, near which he was. A face seemed to
stand out from among the others.</p>

<p>“Mendez! Mendez!” cried Boswell. “Mendez,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
go to the Randall boathouse at once! I need
you there! A whole lot is at stake! There’s a
hundred dollars in it for you from me! Go, do
you hear! The Randall boathouse! Get there as
soon as you can! I’ll meet you after this race!
Do you hear?” and Boswell fairly screamed the
words.</p>

<p>“Yes, senor, I hear,” replied the Mexican. “I
go,” and he started off on the run, for Boswell’s
manner was such that it carried conviction with it.
And then Boswell set himself to the race again.
But he had hesitated just a moment&mdash;just a fatal
moment&mdash;and the next instant, with the lads in
them picking up their strokes, the Fairview and
Boxer Hall shells passed him.</p>

<p>“I’m done for!” murmured Boswell.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII</a><br />
<small>MENDEZ EXPLAINS</small></h2>


<p>“Come on, Boswell!”</p>

<p>“Row hard!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to row!”</p>

<p>“It’s your last chance!”</p>

<p>Thus his mates encouraged the Randall lad in
the single shell, as the three craft swept on up to
the finish line in front of the new boathouse.
But it was not to be. Boswell pulled with all his
strength. Never had there been seen a better exhibition
on Sunny River, but it was too late. His
little hesitation when he had called to Mendez&mdash;the
excited state of his mind, in wondering at
Tom’s accusation&mdash;all contributed to his defeat.
The slight delay was fatal.</p>

<p>“Oh, row! Row!” implored Bean Perkins.
“Give him a song, fellows!” and that grand Latin
chorus of the ancients pealed out.</p>

<p>But it was not to be. Fairview was leading, with
Boxer second and poor Boswell third. And in this
order they finished, giving Fairview her first win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
of the day, and Boxer her first defeat. As for
Randall, once more she tasted bitterness.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Boswell!” called someone,
and, though he was no favorite, no one could withhold
from the measure of praise due him for his
plucky effort. Few knew what had contributed to
his defeat. Even his rivals, hearing him call to
the man on the bank, only thought him shouting
to some friend, and thought how foolish he was
thus to waste his precious time and energy. But
it was none of their business, and so they rowed
on to defeat him.</p>

<p>“Never mind!” consoled Mr. Lighton. “You
rowed the best you could, Boswell, I have no
doubt. It was a fair race.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I could have won,” he panted, and there
were some smiles from those who thought it but
part of his usual boastfulness. But Boswell paid
no attention to them. He was seeking out Tom
Parsons, and the Mexican.</p>

<p>“Get ready for the eight-oared race now,” directed
some of the officials. “Randall, is your
crew ready?”</p>

<p>“All ready,” answered Mr. Lighton.</p>

<p>“Ready,” answered Pinky Davenport, for Boxer
Hall.</p>

<p>“All ready,” assented Roger Barns, for Fairview.</p>

<p>Boswell made his way through the press of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
rowers and spectators, whispered comments following
him. But he paid no attention.</p>

<p>Into the dressing room he strode, where the
crew of the eight were just finishing a little conference
with their coxswain, Jerry Jackson.</p>

<p>“Parsons, a word with you!” exclaimed Boswell,
rather haughtily.</p>

<p>“As many as you like&mdash;after the race,” said
Tom, coldly. He still held clenched in his hand
the brooch. He made up his mind to get it to
Ruth before he went off in the launch that was to
take him and his mates to the starting point. He
had no pocket in which to put it, he could not row
holding it, and he wanted to conceal it from Phil.</p>

<p>“No, now!” snapped Boswell. “Something
unexpected came up as I was on the course. I think
it is due to me to allow me to explain how I came
by that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Here!” exclaimed Tom, anxious that Phil
should not listen. “Make it brief. I can’t understand
what you have to explain, though.”</p>

<p>“You’ll soon know&mdash;someone else will explain,
too. He will be here shortly.”</p>

<p>“Ready for the eight! Ready for the eight!”
came the summons from without.</p>

<p>“Get together, fellows!” called Captain Frank
Simpson. “And for the love of Randall row as
you never rowed before.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t hang back when I call for the spurt,”
added the coxswain.</p>

<p>“Ready for the eight! Ready for the eight!”
again came the summons.</p>

<p>“Come on!” ordered Frank once more, looking
over to where Tom and Boswell were standing,
apart from the others.</p>

<p>“Get a move on, Parsons,” directed Dutch. “If
we win you’ll be the first over the line, being in
the bow. Come on.” Tom had again been made
bow oar.</p>

<p>“No, wait a minute!” implored Boswell. “I
want to say something, Parsons.”</p>

<p>“Won’t after the race do? I can’t listen now.
Besides I’ve got to give Ruth&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It’s about her I want to explain. Hang it,
man, it won’t take a second.”</p>

<p>“Is Boswell in there?” called someone at the
door of the dressing room.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes!” eagerly assented the rich lad.</p>

<p>“There’s a fellow out here wants to see you,”
went on one of the rubbers. “Some sort of a
foreigner. Says you told him to come here
and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Yes! Yes! Let him in!” cried Boswell.
“It’s someone I want to see!”</p>

<p>There was a little stir about the doorway and a
man strolled in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>“Senor Boswell,” he began, “you have sent for
me, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mendez!” gasped Tom.</p>

<p>“Mendez!” echoed Sid, Frank and Phil.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mendez,” spoke Boswell. “Now, Parsons,
I think he’ll tell you that I bought that brooch
from him. Show him the pin!”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;er&mdash;” began the tall pitcher, and then realizing
that concealment from Phil was no longer
possible, he held out the trinket.</p>

<p>“Ruth’s brooch!” cried her brother. “How
in the world did you get it? What does it all
mean?”</p>

<p>“It’s a long story,” said Tom. “We haven’t
time for more than a fraction of it. Boswell had
the pin. He says&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I say I bought it of Mendez, and he’ll tell you
the same thing!” interrupted the rich lad. “Did
I not?” and he appealed to the Mexican. “Didn’t
you bring this to me to-day?”</p>

<p>“Senor Boswell is right,” assented the foreigner.
“I have sold many things to Senor Boswell.
He say for me to look for an old-fashioned brooch
for him, like one his mother has, and he show me
a jewel of the respected Mrs. Boswell, which I
have also procure for him. I get this other one
from Senor Blasdell, from whom I take over the
take-care work on Crest Island.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>“Blasdell!” cried Tom. “Did he sell you this
brooch, Mendez?”</p>

<p>“The senor says what is correct.”</p>

<p>“But where did <em>he</em> get it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Look here, Mendez,” burst out Tom, “do you
know anything about the Farson jewel robbery&mdash;about
the Boxer Hall cups&mdash;about the pawn
tickets? Do you?”</p>

<p>“On my honor, senor, no!” and the man bowed
low. He seemed at ease, and to be speaking the
truth.</p>

<p>“But why did you leave the island so suddenly?”</p>

<p>“Ah, senor, I will tell you. I will confess. In
my country we do not&mdash;that is, we who are of my
class&mdash;we do not consider it a crime to smuggle&mdash;ah,
well, a few cigars. I was guilty of that here.
I smuggle some here and I sell them in my little
store on what you call&mdash;er&mdash;the edge, is it not?”</p>

<p>“The side,” murmured Phil.</p>

<p>“Yes, I thank the senor. I sell smuggled cigars
on the side. It is not a great crime, I think. But
one day word comes to me in the hands of a boy
from a friend, that the government of your country
is about to squeeze me&mdash;am I right?”</p>

<p>“I guess you mean ‘pinch’&mdash;arrest,” suggested
Sid.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is it. I am to be pinched&mdash;Oh, what
a language! Now I have no desire to be pinched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
for what I, personally, do not consider a crime. So
I flee&mdash;I vamoose. I go, and take all I can with
me. Then, later, when it has all been blown
up&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Blown over,” suggested Frank.</p>

<p>“Blown over, yes, I thank you. When it is all
blown over I come back. I have no more smuggled
cigars. I am not in danger of being pinched.
I come back to open my little store, and be the take-care
man on Crest Island.</p>

<p>“As for the gold pin, some time after I leave,
so that I may not be pinched, I meet in New York
the Senor Blasdell. He greet me kindly and say
to me do I not want to buy of him a gold pin. I
deal in jewelry on the edge&mdash;I mean side&mdash;and I
remember that Senor Boswell have commission me
for an old-fashioned pin. I think I have just what
he want. I buy it from Senor Blasdell, and bring
it to Senor Boswell at his college here. That is
all,” and he bowed to all.</p>

<p>“That’s how I got the pin,” said Boswell, coldly,
looking at Tom. “I hope you are satisfied.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” murmured Tom. “But I don’t
understand. Where is Blasdell? Where is that
rascally pawnbroker? Where is the rest of the
jewelry, and the Boxer Hall cups?”</p>

<p>“Say, what are you anyhow, Tom&mdash;a riddle
reader?” demanded Dan Woodhouse.</p>

<p>“What is all this Chinese puzzle about, anyhow?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
asked Jerry Jackson. “If we’re going to
row to-day&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Faith we’d better be gettin’ at ut!” cried
Bricktop, with a twinkle in his blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Where’s the Randall eight?” cried the voice
of Mr. Lighton. “Why aren’t you out here?
We’re waiting.”</p>

<p>“We’re coming!” exclaimed Tom. “Fellows,”
he added, turning to the four of the crew who were
not in on the secret, “we’ll explain later. I’ll see
you after the race,” he called to Boswell.</p>

<p>“As you please,” was the cool answer.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV</a><br />
<small>THE GREAT RACE</small></h2>


<p>“Are you all ready, boys?” inquired Mr.
Lighton.</p>

<p>“My throat’s as dry as a limekiln,” said Bricktop.</p>

<p>The eight, in their shell, were at the starting
point, having gone down in the launch, while the
spider-like boat was towed. On either side of
them were the Boxer and the Fairview eights, with
their crews as eager to get off as were our friends.</p>

<p>“Take a slice of lemon,” went on the coach,
producing one, and a knife from his launch. “Anybody
else have one? Hold the pieces in your
mouth,” he advised.</p>

<p>Several of the lads accepted bits of the citrous
fruit.</p>

<p>“Are your oarlocks all right&mdash;and the stretchers?”
went on the coach.</p>

<p>Everyone tested his own, and no complaint was
forthcoming. Mr. Pierson, who had remained
faithful to the last, said something in a low voice
to Mr. Lighton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” assented the head coach, adding: “Don’t
forget to keep your eyes in the boat, whatever you
do. Your coxswain will watch the other craft, and
tell you when to spurt. This is important&mdash;eyes
in the boat and no talking. You’ve got to row!”</p>

<p>For the other crews, their coaches and advisers
were speaking the last words to the nervous lads.
From time to time those in the Boxer Hall or the
Fairview eight looked over at their rivals. Randall
was to take the middle course, an advantage
that had come to them by lot.</p>

<p>Tom and his three chums wanted desperately to
talk about the dramatic scene enacted in the boathouse
just before they had started, but there was
no chance. They had hurried away, and in the
launch, on the trip down, Mr. Lighton held their
attention. Tom had managed to slip up to Ruth,
and hand her the brooch just before leaving. That
she was surprised is putting it mildly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom! Where on earth did you get it?”
she had cried. “I&mdash;I could hug you for this!” and
her eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>“We’ll postpone the hugging until after the
race! Just cheer for our boat!”</p>

<p>“I will. Oh, Tom, my dear old brooch! Can’t
you tell me how you got it?”</p>

<p>“Not now&mdash;later&mdash;I haven’t time. See you
after the race!” and he had run off to join his
mates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>“How much longer?” asked Frank, as he
shifted himself on his sliding seat.</p>

<p>“Not much, I guess,” replied Mr. Lighton,
looking at his watch. “About&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A shot boomed out from the starter’s boat.</p>

<p>“There goes the warning gun,” the coach interrupted
himself. “A minute more. Take it
easy at the start, boys. It isn’t a hundred-yard
dash, remember. The hard work will come at
the end. Steady all&mdash;eyes in the boat&mdash;row hard&mdash;and&mdash;win!”</p>

<p>And, with these final words, Mr. Lighton
steamed off in his launch, the other coaches also
leaving their crews to themselves.</p>

<p>The race was to be down stream, and, in order
to make an even start, the stern of each shell had
been made fast to an anchored boat in the middle
of the river. At the signal the retaining ropes
were to be loosed, and the race would start. Eager
ears waited for the final signal.</p>

<p>“Get ready boys!” called Jerry Jackson, his
eyes on his watch, which he had fastened before
him. “You’ve got about fifteen seconds more.”</p>

<p>There were sharp intakings of breath, and the
young coxswain, glancing at his crew, noted with
satisfaction that the slight tendency toward nervousness,
exhibited by some, had disappeared.
They were all cool and eager.</p>

<p>Crack! came the report of the starting gun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>On the instant the retaining cables were loosed,
and twenty-four oars seemed to take the water as
one. It was a good, clean, even start.</p>

<p>To bring the finish opposite the boathouse, it
had been necessary to go down the stream some
distance, and there were few spectators gathered
there.</p>

<p>But such as were there gave forth a hearty
cheer, and the yells of the three colleges were given
in turn, for some loyal-hearted lads had sacrificed
their chances to see the finish, that they might
cheer the start.</p>

<p>“Steady, fellows, steady,” counseled Jerry, in
a low voice, as he noticed a tendency to hurry.
“It isn’t time to hit up the pace. They’re both
keeping even with us,” he added.</p>

<p>Then began a steady grind. A leaning forward
of the bodies, with hands well out over the toes,
the dipping of the blades of the oars into the
water, and then that tremendous pull of sixteen
sturdy arms, shoulders and trunk&mdash;the pushing
of sixteen muscular legs, the rising off the seats
to get all the weight possible on the oar at the
point of leverage where it would do the most
good.</p>

<p>Over and over again was this repeated. Over
and over again, with the eyes of seven of the men
on the back of the man in front of him timing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
movement, and with the eyes of the stroke on the
coxswain, to catch the slightest signal.</p>

<p>Stroke after stroke&mdash;movement after movement,
one just like the other&mdash;twenty-eight to the
minute, Jerry having started them off with that
minimum.</p>

<p>And what Randall was doing, so was Fairview
and Boxer Hall, in the same degree.</p>

<p>The first mile was passed, with the net result
that all three shells were on even terms, albeit one
or the other had forged ahead slightly, not because
either one had quickened the pace so much
consciously as that they had done so unconsciously,
and there was, of course, a difference in the muscular
power at times.</p>

<p>They were half way over the second mile&mdash;half
the course had been rowed.</p>

<p>Frank Simpson, watching Jerry, saw the little
coxswain shoot a quick glance toward the Boxer
Hall boat, and then stiffen in his seat.</p>

<p>“Hit it up!” cried Jerry, and he gave the signal
for a thirty-per-minute stroke. But, even as he
did Frank, risking something by taking his eyes off
the coxswain, looked across the lane of water.</p>

<p>He saw the Fairview boat shoot ahead, while,
the next instant the Randall shell, urged onward
by the increased stroke, tried to minimize the advantage
gained.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV</a><br />
<small>THE EIGHT-OARED VICTORS</small></h2>


<p>“Here they come, boys! Get ready!” yelled
Bean Perkins, wildly waving his megaphone.
“Here they come!”</p>

<p>“Oh wow!” shouted Joe Jackson. “For the
love of Cæsar tell us who’s ahead.”</p>

<p>“It’s hard to see from here. But I think&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, who cares what you <em>think</em>?” interrupted
a lad. “Don’t give us any false information.”</p>

<p>“Get ready boys!” cried Bean again. “The
college cheer when they get opposite the old boathouse,
and then the ‘Conquer or Die’ song. We’ve
got to pull ’em on!”</p>

<p>All was excitement. A hundred voices mingled
in expressions of hopes and fears. The rival college
cheers blended into one riotous conglomeration
of sound. The three shells were sweeping on
to victory&mdash;victory for just one!</p>

<p>“Oh, Madge!” cried Ruth. “I daren’t look.
Here, you take the field glasses, and tell me who’s
ahead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>Her own college colors slipped from her dress
unheeded, and there was disclosed the tiny knot of
Randall’s maroon and yellow.</p>

<p>“Ruth!” expostulated Mabel, as she pointed
to the traitorous hues.</p>

<p>“I don’t care!” replied Ruth, as her hand went
to where her restored brooch was at her throat.</p>

<p>“Who’s ahead?” demanded Helen Newton, as
Madge peered through the glasses.</p>

<p>“Fairview!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“She is! She is! Oh, girls, Fairview is going
to win!”</p>

<p>“Who&mdash;who is second?” demanded Mabel.</p>

<p>“Randall!” came the reply.</p>

<p>Then there was silence. The girls looked at
one another. What they thought, who shall say?</p>

<p>On came the three shells. The cheers increased.
There was a din of horns and rattles. The band
played madly&mdash;no one knew what the tune was&mdash;and
cared less.</p>

<p>“Steady all!” cried Jerry, as he noticed a tendency
to quicken. “Steady all!”</p>

<p>On came the Randall shell. Just a little to her
rear was Boxer Hall, struggling desperately and
with breaking hearts to offset the disadvantage of
overtraining and over-confidence. For that is
just what it amounted to. It looked hopeless for
them now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>As for Fairview, she had maintained the lead
she had unexpectedly gained over Randall, and the
eager&mdash;almost bursting&mdash;hearts in the boat hoped
that the co-educational college could row it out
unto the end. But there was no disguising the fact
to themselves that they were rowing against such a
rival as they had never before met.</p>

<p>For a moment after Jerry had given the word
to increase the stroke, his chums thought that he
would keep them on that for a hundred yards or
so, and then hit up the pace still faster. But he
did not. Instead, coolly and calmly, he glanced critically
at the Fairview shell, and kept on at the
same rate.</p>

<p>“Hang it all, why doesn’t he give the word
to spurt?” thought Frank, as his broad back rose
and fell to the measured rhythm. “We can do
it!”</p>

<p>But Jerry was a wise little coxswain. Not for
nothing had he spied out the course, so that he
knew every foot of it, and by marks previously
noted, he could tell exactly how far they were
from the finish mark.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer to it came the eight-oared
shells. Boxer Hall was struggling hard to pull up,
but for once she had met her match&mdash;two, in fact,
for it was easy now to see that the race, barring
accidents, lay between Randall and Fairview.</p>

<p>“And, oh! May we win!” prayed Tom and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
chums. And they could not understand why Jerry
would not put them at their limit. True, their
hearts were pumping at an abnormal rate, their
muscles strained as they never had before, and
their breath came labored, and went out gaspingly.</p>

<p>And then, when Coxswain Jerry, with his eager
eyes, saw a certain old gnarled tree on the river
bank, and when he had noted that Fairview had
added another stroke per minute, then and not
until then did he give the word.</p>

<p>He had slid down into his seat, feeling the tiller
lines as a horseman feels with the reins the mouth
of his pet racer. Gently, as if the shell were some
delicate machine, did Jerry guide her on the course.
Now the time had come!</p>

<p>Up he sat, like one electrified. Through the
megaphone strapped to his mouth came the words:</p>

<p>“Row, boys! Row as you never rowed before!
Put all you can to the stroke. I call for thirty-three!
Give it to ’em! Give it to ’em!”</p>

<p>It seemed as though the Randall shell was suddenly
galvanized into action. Reaching forward
over their toes, eight sturdy backs bent for the
stroke. Then it came.</p>

<p>A pull that seemed to lift the frail shell from
the water&mdash;a pull that strained on the outriggers&mdash;a
pull that made the stout oars creak and bend!
A stroke that sent the water swirling aft in rings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
circles, whirlpools and a smother of foam! A
stroke that told!</p>

<p>“Row! Row!” screamed Jerry.</p>

<p>Daring another glance, Frank, at stroke, saw
the Fairview boat seemingly at a standstill. But
it was not so. It was that Randall had shot up to
her.</p>

<p>From the shores, from the boathouse, from the
other craft, came a riot of sound&mdash;shouts, yells,
the tooting of horns, the clatter of rattles.</p>

<p>There was a veritable flower garden of waving
colors. The shrill voices of the girls mingled with
the hoarser shouts of the men and boys. Whistles
blew, and dogs barked to add to the din.</p>

<p>“Row! Row!” Jerry fairly screamed.</p>

<p>“Pick it up, boys!” pleaded the Fairview coxswain.
He had not thought that his rivals had this
spurt in them.</p>

<p>“Can’t you do it? Can’t you get up to them?”
begged Pinky Davenport, of his Boxer lads, and
there were unashamed tears in his eyes as he made
his last appeal. But Boxer was “all in.”</p>

<p>“Now boys, now!” shouted Jerry. “It’s your
last chance! A hundred yards more&mdash;only three
hundred feet! Row! Row! We must win.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let ’em pass us!” came from the Fairview
coxswain. “A few strokes&mdash;only a few
more!”</p>

<p>The boats were even! Pandemonium had now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
broken loose. The band was drowned out by
shouts. Ruth found herself hammering Madge
on the back, and shouting&mdash;she knew not what&mdash;in
her ear. Madge was crying&mdash;she did not know
why.</p>

<p>As for the Randall lads, they were mere machines.
There was no more thought left in them.
They saw nothing, but each man in front of him
viewed his fore-man’s back&mdash;Frank could not see
the face of Jackson, but he could hear his rasping
voice.</p>

<p>“Row! Row!”</p>

<p>How Frank heaved! How he dug at the giving
water at the end of his blade as though he would
tear it from the river and fling it aloft in a rainbow
arch.</p>

<p>And how Bricktop Molloy took up the stroke,
his honest Irish face wet with sweat&mdash;his red hair
plastered down on his forehead. Back and forth
he bent. After him came Holly Cross picking up
the stroke masterly&mdash;then Kindlings&mdash;good old
Kindlings with something of the fire of his name
in his sturdy muscles&mdash;then Housenlager&mdash;all the
desire for horseplay gone from him. Then Sid,
who had been shifted back to Number Three almost
at the last moment. Then Phil, and then
Tom.</p>

<p>And how they rowed! Surely the ancient gods&mdash;surely
even Hercules at his twelve labors&mdash;never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
toiled more Titanically than these eight rowers.
No galley slave, chained to the oar, with the
vessel on fire above him, with the shrieks of the
dying in his ears, the stench of Greek fire in his
nostrils, ever rowed more desperately.</p>

<p>“Row! Row!” screamed Jerry.</p>

<p>“Row! Row!” echoed Roger Barns.</p>

<p><a href="#image01">The finish line was but a hundred feet away.</a>
Slowly, oh, so slowly, did the Randall boat creep
up on her rival.</p>

<p>Now she was past! Another electric thrill went
through Jerry.</p>

<p>“Row! Row!” he screamed, and his voice was
hoarse. His hands, tense and gripped, were
clasped so tightly on the tiller ropes, that afterward
they had to loosen them for him. The muscles
had gone dead, but he steered with the skill
of a veteran.</p>

<p>It grew black before Tom’s eyes. He felt
that his lungs were bursting. Frank knew that if
he dipped the oar in the water again he would not
have strength to pull it out.</p>

<p>But, somehow he did!</p>

<p>And then with one last spurt, a spurt that
seemed to wrench the very roots of their hearts,
a pull that seemed to tear their very muscles loose,
the lads in the Randall shell sent their boat over
the finish line a winner&mdash;a winner by half a length&mdash;a
winner! They were the eight-oared victors!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>And, as they realized this&mdash;as it came to them&mdash;their
eyes that saw not lighted up&mdash;their faces,
seamed and lined with the contracted muscles,
broke into smiles, and then Tom toppled over on
his oar, and Frank fell weakly back on Molloy.</p>

<p>“Easy there, me lad, easy,” panted Bricktop.
“It’s all over. You collapsed at the right minute!
Oh, wow, but I’m thirsty!”</p>

<p>Jerry Jackson was struggling with the tiller lines
wound about his nerveless hands. Ready chums
loosed them, and helped him from the shell onto a
boat, the crew having recovered sufficiently to put
their broad blades out on the water to steady the
shell.</p>

<p>And then, following the hush that came after
the hysterical outburst which greeted the winners,
came floating over the heads of the great throng:</p>

<p>“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aut Vincere! Aut Mori!</i>”</p>

<p>But Randall had conquered, though she had
nearly died.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Somehow the crew heard the cheers for themselves,
for their coach and for the plucky little coxswain.
Somehow they managed to cheer Fairview
and Boxer Hall, and then they were hurried into
the dressing rooms.</p>

<p>“I knew you could do it! I knew you could do
it!” cried Mr. Lighton, capering about like a boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
“I knew we could make a rowing crew in one season
with the material we had.”</p>

<p>“Faith, an’ ye did, me lad!” declared Bricktop,
while Housenlager feebly punched Tom in the
ribs, a bit of horseplay that our hero was too tired
to resent.</p>

<p>“Someone to see Mr. Parsons!” called Wallops,
the college messenger, who was helping out
at the boathouse. He peered into the anteroom
of the dressing apartments.</p>

<p>“I can’t see anyone now,” declared Tom. “Who
is it?”</p>

<p>“He says his name is Farson, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The jeweler!” cried Tom. “Show him in!”
and he came from under a shower and grabbed up
some garments. “There must be something doing!”
he added to Sid and Phil, who had heard
the words.</p>

<p>Somewhat bewildered by the athletic throng
about him, the jeweler entered.</p>

<p>“Where are you, Mr. Parsons?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Here!” cried Tom. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“Everything! I have just received word from
the police that they have arrested that pawnbroker.
He has all the Boxer Hall cups, and most
of the other jewelry. Nearly everything is recovered.
All but that old-fashioned brooch you
told me about. That he says he never had.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>“And he’s right,” added Tom. “I recovered
that. But who took the things?”</p>

<p>“Blasdell. The island caretaker took them out
of my box when the boat landed on the island, and
disposed of them. Then he hid the pawn tickets in
the shack, taking away the brooch he had previously
hidden there.</p>

<p>“Blasdell has been arrested too. He has made
a full confession. He and the pawnbroker have
been in with a bad set, and were planning other
crimes. But I will soon have nearly everything
back. I thought you might be glad to know, so I
came here as soon as I heard. I had to wait until
after the race, though.”</p>

<p>“We are glad to hear the news,” spoke Frank.
“So Mendez is not in it after all.”</p>

<p>“No, the confessions of the others completely
clear him. I must go tell the Boxer Hall boys the
good news.”</p>

<p>“And it is almost as good news to us as to
them,” said Tom, as he went in to finish dressing.</p>

<p>The regatta was over. Randall, in spite of
heavy odds and in spite of losing all but one race,
was proclaimed champion of the Tonoka Lake
League.</p>

<p>“But we’ll do you next year!” prophesied Pinky
Davenport. “I think the loss of our cups was a
hoodoo to us.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” admitted Tom. “But next year is&mdash;well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
next year, and we’re not greenies any more.”</p>

<p>“I guess you never were,” admitted his rival.</p>

<p>“And now let’s go see the girls, and tell them
how sorry we are that we beat them,” proposed
Sid.</p>

<p>If the girls felt badly they did not show it much.</p>

<p>“What I can’t understand,” said Phil, a little
later, when he and his chums, and his sister and
her chums were talking it all over at a little supper
in Haddonfield, “what I can’t understand is how
Boswell knew Ruth had lost her pin, and wanted
to give her another.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t know it&mdash;stupid!” exclaimed Ruth,
with a blush. “Only Tom knew it.”</p>

<p>“But Boswell was going to give you a pin.”</p>

<p>“Oh, can’t a fellow give a girl a pin without
knowing that she has lost one or you making a
fuss over it?” asked Sid.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;” faltered Phil.</p>

<p>“He heard that I was fond of old-fashioned
jewelry,” explained Ruth, blushing, “and I suppose,
instead of&mdash;er&mdash;well&mdash;say candy, he hunted
up an old-style pin. He had bought one for his
mother from Mendez, and wanted one for me.
It was lucky that Blasdell did not pawn my pin
with the other stuff. Instead he sold it to Mendez,
who, in turn, sold it to Mr. Boswell, and Tom&mdash;well,
Tom did the rest.”</p>

<p>“And you were without grandmother’s pin all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
that while, and never let on!” cried Phil. “Oh,
you’re a sly one, Sis!”</p>

<p>“And the colored handkerchiefs, and Boswell
were useless as clues,” went on Sid. “They were
just false alarms. But I wonder why Mendez
was so anxious to see Boswell that day we went on
our little picnic?”</p>

<p>“Mendez explained that,” said Tom. “He
had had some intimation that his selling of smuggled
cigars was likely to be dangerous, and, as
Boswell had bought some he wanted to talk about
it, and get his advice. That was all. It seems that
when Boswell and the Mexican were together on
the island one day Mendez cut his finger and Boswell
tore off a strip of the silk handkerchief. Boswell
told me that.”</p>

<p>“And I guess that explains everything,” remarked
Phil. “I want some more ice-cream.
We’ve broken training now, you know.”</p>

<p>And so the merry little party feasted and
laughed and softly sang their college songs until
the girls protested that they must get back, or Miss
Philock&mdash;well, various opinions were expressed
about that lady.</p>

<p>“Stop that infernal clock!” grunted Tom, a
little later, as he lay half asleep on the old sofa
in the common room.</p>

<p>“Stop it yourself,” murmured Phil, sprawled in
one easy chair, while Frank occupied another. Sid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
had declared himself done up after the race, and
had gone to bed. From his room he murmured in
a sleepy voice:</p>

<p>“Sounds like Jerry calling&mdash;‘Stroke! Stroke!
Stroke!’ doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Cut it out!” said Phil. “I don’t want to see
an oar for six months again.”</p>

<p>“It will be pigskin punts from now on,” spoke
Tom, as he returned from jabbing a toothpick into
the clock’s interior, and turned over to doze again.</p>

<p>“And then good old Winter!” exclaimed Frank.
“I say, fellows, what’s the matter with getting up
some iceboat races,” and he galvanized into uprightness.</p>

<p>“Talk about it to-morrow,” sleepily murmured
Sid, but the suggestion bore fruit, as you may learn
by reading the next volume of this series, to be
called “Rivals of the Ice; A Story of Winter Sports
at College.” It will tell how, after a strenuous
football season, the lads formed an ice league, for
skating, hockey playing, and ice-yacht racing.</p>

<p>Outside the college there was singing and the
building of bonfires to celebrate the victory of the
crew. But in their room, four of the eight-oared
victors dozed dreamily on, living over again in
fancy that strenuously-fought-out race which they
had so labored over. And there, for a time, we
will leave them.</p>
